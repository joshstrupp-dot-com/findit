"Gladwell argues that success is tightly married to opportunity and time on task. He states that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something and that gives me comfort. It helps me feel better about my many failures at initial attempts to master things (like glazing pottery, algebra, Salsa dancing, skiing and sewing... to name a few). I kept thinking, ""I've just got to put in more hours if I want to do better."" While I can see a different way of spinning the data provided to support Gladwell's argument, I didn't care. In a rare moment, I found myself not wanting to argue. : ) Instead, I found myself reflecting on things that have felt like lucky opportunities in my own life. This reflection was very humbling. Moreover, I felt the text tugging at the need for greater equity. What could all the people with limited opportunities do if given greater opportunities? Think Darfur. How many people who might have come up with the cure for pancreatic cancer been forced to spend their time standing in lines waiting for clean water or food? My own personal experience as a teacher of refugees reflects Gladwell's primary thesis. Many of my refugee students are pre-literate. They have not been given the opportunity to gain a formal education. As a result, there are many well-intended, but misinformed people who place these students in special education courses or deem their I.Q. low, diminishing their opportunities even more. The students I teach are hungry for skills and spend hours outside of class practicing. They make huge gains despite earlier opportunities denied them. While many will not go on to big colleges out of high school, I feel like given enough opportunity and time they could make it there. Sadly, many have families who depend on them to work to help financially support the family. (Yet, another limited opportunity to spend time focused on developing skills.) In the past week, I have shared Gladwell's thesis with my students. We have applied the 10,000 hours to master a task to reading and writing. I remind students that if we don't get our 10,000 hours this year together, they must continue on their own. I remind them that it IS possible to move forward if they are focused and keep adding hours of work to their reading and writing. We even write on the board how many hours left before we are masters. ""2 hours down, only 9,998 left to go.""Friday, I had a student from Somalia smile and ask, ""So it's not true that white people are smarter than black Africans? They just get more chances to read?"" Imagine my pleasure when I could respond, ""YES! That's correct. You are just as smart as any white kid in this school. It's just that some of them have been reading for years and you are just getting started."" Thank you for your work Galdwell, it is salient in today's political conversation surrounding education (especially for our most vulnerable students who have been given the fewest opportunities).",Outliers: by Malcolm Gladwell | The Story of Success | Summary & Takeaways,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.056,0.759,0.185,0.9967,Positive,Very Helpful,0.7512154579162598
"When I think about Malcolm Gladwell, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""less than meets the eye."" At first glance, his work seems thoroughly researched, even visionary at times. Beginning with a few maverick, counter-intuitive insights, he often ends with an affirmation of consensus, but it is a consensus that has been broadened by investigation and enriched by nuance.On second look, however, I'm no longer sure any of this is true. What first appeared to be new insights are nothing but familiar landmarks, previously unrecognizable because of the adoption of a deliberately mannered perspective; even the once apparent breadth and nuance now seem triumphs of language over logic, the apparent inevitability of his arguments an illusion conjured by the spell of his limpid prose.Take one small example from ""Outliers."" With a flurry of standardized test statistics, Gladwell makes the case that the traditional summer vacation--however rewarding it may be for the middle class--is just not working for the poor. (I'll concede the point, for the sake of argument, but any high school teacher will tell you how suspect conclusions drawn from such statistics can be.) He then presents a sustained anecdote about a successful all-year-round secondary school in a poor neighborhood. His conclusion? We should go to school year round. Sounds reasonable, right? But what about a more obvious solution: as a society we could decide to work together so that summer can be a learning experience for the poor by instituting a myriad of basketball camps, music camps, art camps, chess camps, traditional summer camps, etc., held at schools, community centers, and city parks, and staffed by college students, artists and teachers from the neighborhood. Gladwell often reminds me of the last panel of a Dilbert cartoon: two panels of plain-speaking criticism, followed by one panel of resignation. And no real insight, no real hope for the future.",Outliers: by Malcolm Gladwell | The Story of Success | Summary & Takeaways,Malcolm Gladwell,2.0,0.108,0.805,0.087,-0.7551,Negative,Somewhat Harmful,0.5131129622459412
"I know, you don’t think you have the time and there are other and more important books to read at the moment, but be warned, you do need to read this book.There are a number of ways I can tell a book will be good; one of those ways is if Graham has recommended it to me (how am I going to cope without our lunches together, mate?). And there is basically one way for me to I know that I’ve really enjoyed a book, and that is if I keep telling people about it over and over again. Well, not since Predictably Irrational  (also recommended to me by Graham) have I gone on and on about a book to people. First to Ruth over lunch, then to mum on the phone, and then the kids after they had just gotten out of bed in the early hours of the afternoon – my poor children, I’ve told them virtually the entire book.Now it is your turn.As a culture we tend to believe that people who are successful (people like Mozart, Bill Gates, The Beatles) all are ‘self-made-men’ and have risen to the summit of achievement on the basis of some incredibly special power they have and that we do not. It is a comforting thought, in some ways. If we have not done as well we are hardly to blame, because we just didn’t have that certain something. We don’t have the thing that sets them people apart from the crowd. And in this cult of celebrity we even get a chance to live vicariously in the reflection of their glory. Perhaps we can never all be Lady Di, (at least, not in public) but we can all attempt suicide with a pate knife and get into colonic irrigation. John Safran talks somewhere about a guy he knows saying to him that the only reason John made it and he didn’t was because John was Jewish. John then talks about how much hard work he had to put in to becoming successful, none of which relied on the mythical leg up he would have gotten from some secret Jewish conspiracy. This book isn’t about Lady Di, but it is about a series of biographies of people who have become incredibly successful. The biographies are generally told twice. The first time in a way that confirms all our prejudices about self made men and then in a way that makes sense of the success in ways we may find much more uncomfortable. I really struggled with this book – I loved every minute of it, but I still felt remarkably challenged by it. It was very hard not to think of my own life while reading this book. And this did not make me feel comfortable.I guess we are all fairly predictable, and one of the things that makes us especially predictable is that we generally like to have our prejudices confirmed. We buy books that tell us over and over again what we already know and believe. The Left Behind series is just one such example, as are most self help books. And I’m as guilty of this as anyone else. But there is a much better sensation we can get from a book, although this is much more rare. It is when the person you are reading starts telling you the deeper reasons why your beliefs are valid and not just based on prejudice. I have always believed talent is another (although, less apparent and all too vague) word for hard work. I’ve also believed that we are products of a range of different variables too complex to know in any real detail. This book confirms those prejudices.First he talks about ice hockey and a fascinating fact about the birthdays of the best players. They are all born at around the same time of the year. It is as if there is a cut off date for when you will be a professional ice hockey player – and, in fact, there is. The short version is that if you are born on the wrong side of the date they use to group kids into age levels you are likely to be a year younger than the other kids you are playing ice hockey with and therefore a year smaller than them too. That is going to make them look like they are better players than you are – and they will be too. A year at 10 is a huge difference, a huge advantage. And then we compound that advantage, by giving the older kids more practice, more experience in games and then more experience and more practice until there is no way the kid who happened to be born on the wrong side of the cut off date has any chance of catching up.The point he makes strongly here and repeatedly in the first part of the book is that there are other factors to success that are more than just ‘natural ability’. In fact, he does not believe in ‘natural ability’ – only in effort and time. Essentially he shows that if you put in 10,000 hours on any task you will be highly proficient at that task. Innate ability does not exist and ability is actually a function of effort expended. This is both liberating and incredibly challenging. Liberating because success is related to the effort you put in (and I think you should believe that is true even if it isn’t – it is the myth of Sisyphus, the only way we can really cope with the world is to believe our efforts have meaning). Challenging, because ultimately we are responsible for our own success as we are directly responsible for how much effort we are prepared to put in.The second great theme of this book is that where you come from matters. The culture that we are from has a remarkable impact on the rest of our lives. For example, if you are from a working class background you are much less likely to approach life with an attitude of ‘entitlement’. When people in authority speak to you, you are probably less likely to question them. In fact, you might believe you should defer to them. You are probably more likely to believe rules exist for a reason and that rules can’t be changed and can’t be moved. People from the middle class are much more likely to see rules as things that can be shaped or changed or ignored to make their life more easy or rewarding. Having come from the working class, even a particularly radical end of it, I can still see aspects of this deference in my own character and this was perhaps the most challenging part of the book for me.The other challenging bit was the part about the Hatfields and McCoys. As a Northern Irish boy, even if I’m not as obsessed with ‘honour’ as I might have been, this does make sense of things I have wondered about for a long time. The solution might be a little too neat, but the Irish, particularly the Northern Irish, are far too likely to feuds that are intractable and recognising that that might have cultural roots beyond the excuse of religion is utterly fascinating to me.The lessons of this book can be put into a brief sentence: success depends on a series of cultural and other factors that are mostly beyond your control – however, the thing that is totally within your control about success is how much effort you put in. And the more effort you put in the more likely you will be successful. They are directly proportional and we should all praise work as the key thing that really makes us human.I loved this book. I noticed that Ginnie points to a pilot who disputes some of what Gladwell says about culture and plane crashes, but this is a minor point. His bigger point about culture and plane crashes still stands and is remarkable. If you have kids, read this book – it will give you hints on how to bring them up with perhaps a modest sense of entitlement – it could make all of the difference. Ginnie also has a link to an article with a photo of the man himself – I was saying to the kids yesterday that I would give a couple of toes to look nearly as cool as he does, but I think it would take more than just toes.Look, what can I say? Read this book, it is life altering.

"Didn't exactly read this book - Joe and I listened to it in the car on the way home from visiting family for Christmas. I really enjoyed it, and was very fascinated by certain parts of it, especially the sections about the Beatles, computer programmers and Korean co-pilots.But my enjoyment of the book was marred by the glaring absence of any well-known female ""outliers."" By chapter four or so, I noticed it and mentioned it to Joe, and then it just kept getting worse to the point that it was comical and distracting. Man after man after high-achieving man was featured. Any time a woman was mentioned, it seemed she was a wife or mother helping to boost a high achiever to success - or, in one case toward the end of the book, a somewhat slow female math student that a male professor had videotaped trying to figure out a math problem. By the time we got to that vignette, it was so ridiculous that Joe and I both started laughing, and Joe joked that ""the only woman in the book is dumb - but persistent.""When we got home, I Googled ""Gladwell Outliers sexist"" or something like that and found that several female bloggers and columnists also were ticked off about it and had taken Gladwell to task for it. Gladwell doesn't strike me as a raging sexist, so my guess is that he is so used to being a male in this world and constantly hearing about and identifying with male high achievers that maybe he didn't even realize what he was doing. I noticed that he gave a pretty weak response when questioned in an interview about his omission of women - he claimed that he had not omitted women because he mentioned his grandmother's story at the end of the book, in the epilogue, I think.

"The Banality of Neoliberalism...1) Sloppy methodology: --Let's take a gentle start. Even a lottery has real people winning it. If your methodology is to only examine the winners (and bypass the structure of the lottery system), then you can surely come up with some highly entertaining (and biased) results!--The whole point of study designs/methodologies and statistics is to analyze the chaotic noise of the real world without getting distracted by certain human heuristics/biases (this does not mean we can avoid morals/politics, more later); see Ben Goldacre:-I Think You'll Find It's a Bit More Complicated Than That-Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks...In fact, Goldacre has a couple words on Gladwell: On my left shoulder there is an angel. She says it's risky to extrapolate from rarefied laboratory conditions to the real world. She says that publication bias in this field [psychology] is extensive, so whenever researches get negative findings, they're probably left unpublished in a desk drawer. And she says it's uncommon to see a genuinely systematic review of the literature on these topics, so you rarely get to see all the conflicting research in one place. My angel has read the books of Malcolm Gladwell, and she finds them to be silly and overstated.--Here's a revealing interview of Gladwell as a salesperson rather than a serious social theorist, study design be damned (emphases added; source: https://www.avclub.com/malcolm-gladwe... ): The A.V. Club: Your books all focus on singularities—in The Tipping Point, singular events, in Blink, singular moments, and in Outliers, singular people. Was there a single instance in your life that made you start seeing the world in terms of single points?Malcolm Gladwell: I just think I'm attracted to those kinds of singular things because they always make the best stories. I'm in the storytelling business, and so you're always drawn to the unusual. And early on, I discovered that's the easiest way to tell stories, so I've stuck with it ever since. And if you come up through a newspaper as I did, your whole goal is to get a story on the front page, and you only get something on the front page if it's unusual, so you're quickly weaned off the notion that you should be interested in the mundane. ...My definition of ""mundane"" (banality) features salespeople (con artists?) pretending to popularize social theory while actually just selling quirky stories that conveniently re-enforce status quo myths. 2) A First-World, Middle-Class Fantasy:--""John Steinbeck once said that socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires."" -Ronald Wright--Onto morals/politics: the real-world lottery system, with its violent conquests, inherited wealth, abstract contradictions and social struggles are whitewashed into a bland, apolitical marketplace composed of competitive automatons each trying to maximize their personal gains/utility, culminating in a meritocracy. --On this edifice, we see the heaps of First-World glossy-covered self-help (The 4-Hour Workweek), pop-psy, pop-econ (Freakonomics), and business books to make the target audience feel more professional/self-accomplished. --Of course, this system (capitalism, state capitalism, neoliberalism, whatever you want to call it) has to work for some given its ceaseless mobilization of wage labour generating tremendous surpluses to extract from. The question is to what degree competition and meritocracy exist (not to mention the perverse consequences, let alone alternatives). --Gladwell's storytelling features some highly political figures (Gates/Skadden/Oppenheimer); we have firmly stepped outside of cute marketing gimmicks and quirky entertainment/sports stats...--Sterilizing the politics from the story requires limiting the scope of analysis to make meritocracy (""10,000-Hour Rule"" to gain world-class expertise) more plausible. This requires skimming off undeserving peoples, usually starting with a national/colonial bias (by assuming the US/First World) and then certain classes/social groups. --However, the system of capitalism is global; that was the whole point of colonialism, the slave market, the ""coolie"" market that replaced slavery, and today's transnational corporations and institutions (World Trade Organization, World Bank, IMF) backed by the US military to maintain capitalism's imperialism. Many poor countries are perfectly embedded into global capitalism, being the most ""open for business"" for transnational corporations their resources, dump their pollution, and (crucially) prevent alternatives (""Red Scare"", ""War on Terror"", etc.): The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions...Global capitalism features social dislocation, be it:i) Booms of financial speculation/gentrification (And the Weak Suffer What They Must? Europe's Crisis and America's Economic Future) and jobless growth (Capitalism: A Ghost Story), or ii) Busts leaving behind rust belts and mega slums (Planet of Slums). ...Thus, there's always enough dispossessed poor people to exploit (tens of millions of preventable deaths each year under global capitalism is somehow normalized), just as there's always enough environment to exploit (well, until that collapses: Facing the Anthropocene: Fossil Capitalism and the Crisis of the Earth System).--Curiously, the US (in particular the book's ""middle class"" target audience) is more and more experiencing the spatial (global) and temporal (boom/bust cycles) nature of capitalism that have ravaged the Global South. --The most destructive war in human history (WWII) was the ""creative destruction"" that saved global capitalism from the endless Great Depression, with the US as chief creditor/arms dealer. The post-WWII boom built the US ""middle class"" with the US as the factory of the world; this lasted only decades before it collapsed under contradictions (Super Imperialism: The Origin and Fundamentals of U.S. World Dominance). --The US's next ""creative destruction"" was to smash its unions and factories (outsourcing) to unleash Wall Street's Finance Capitalism, resulting in the past 40+ years of global booms/busts while parts of the US were left with Rust Belt deindustrialization, opioid crises, precarious work, mass homelessness and uninsured, etc. --Without a clear understanding of the profit-seeking spatial/temporal logic and disruptions of global capitalism (indeed abstract, where long-term power hides), those disillusioned with the status quo are susceptible to scapegoating, symptomatic explanations targeting the visibly-different and vulnerable.

"Occasionally insightful, but Gladwell's science is pretty junky. His reasons for success change by the page. And he cherry-picks examples to exactly fit the scheme under consideration.

"Malcolm Gladwell's new book reads like a series of cocktail-party anecdotes. Whether the book is a mere fluff piece or something more is open to debate. At its heart, it has two themes: (1) That success depends not just on talent but opportunity, and (2) that success (and failure) also depend on the cultural legacies we inherit from our forebears. Boiled down, here are his essential ideas:OPPORTUNITY1. Luck matters. Hockey players who happened to be born between January and March were disproportionately represented in professional hockey leagues. From an early age, these players were the oldest in their age bracket, and therefore bigger and more coordinated. Coaches selected them for better training and playing opportunities, and overtime, success bred success. Likewise, students who happened to be older for their class scored higher on math and science tests than their younger classmates, and were more likely to be picked for ""gifted"" and other advanced programs. 2. Even smart people need 10,000 hours of practice before they master a skill. Those that can get those 10,000 hours during childhood are a step ahead. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and The Beatles all had unique opportunities to have lots and lots of practice in their specialties at an early age before becoming successful.3. After 120, increases in IQ are less important than creativity and ""practical intelligence"" -- knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect. A lifelong study of geniuses showed they were no more successful than the average population. Nobel laureates are just as likely to come from City College of NY, Augsburg College, or Gettysburg College as they are from Harvard.LEGACY4. Rural Americans in backcountry states -- Kentucky, Tennessee, North & South Carolina -- inherited a ""culture of honor"" from their Scotch-Irish forefathers. These herdsmen warriors brought with them a willingness to fight in response to the smallest slight. This led to a pattern of bloody and violent feuds between families across the Appalachian states. (Think Hatfields vs. McCoys.)5. Korean Airlines had an unusually high rate of plane crashes because of the Korean culture's extreme deference to superiors. Junior pilots were reluctant to directly contradict their Captain on a flight, even in the face of grave error. This explains, for instance, the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam in 1997. When the airline hired a specialist from Delta to retrain the pilots to speak more transparently, their safety record went up dramatically.6. Asians are good at math and science because their ancestors planted rice paddies. Rice farming was more labor intensive than Western agriculture. Asians have inherited this stick-with-it-ness that allows them to excel in math and science, where perseverance is mandatory.7. Unlike rice paddies, wheat or corn fields need to be left fallow every few years. Early American educators adopted this principle toward schooling - that students must not be exhausted. Hence, the long summer vacation, a distinctly American legacy. But this legacy is counterproductive, because kids tend to forget things over the summer. Kids who go to schools with shorter summer breaks tend to have higher test scores.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",Outliers: by Malcolm Gladwell | The Story of Success | Summary & Takeaways,Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.064,0.795,0.141,0.9936,Positive,Somewhat Harmful,0.35502889752388
"I can save you the trouble of reading the book: smart people don't automatically become successful, they do so because they got lucky. This rule applies to everyone including the likes of Bill Gates and Robert Oppenheimer. That's it. That's what the whole book is about. Gladwell looks at case after case of this: Canadian hockey players, Korean airline pilots, poor kids in the Bronx, Jewish lawyers, etc... Even with all this evidence it feels like he's pulling in examples that fit his theory and ignoring others. Thus while we look at many examples of geniuses who got lucky we do not look at Einstein which seems strange as he's the best known genius of the 20th century. While the book can be summarized in one sentence, the individual chapters are interesting such as the chapter that discusses a plane crash that happened in New York because the pilots were too subservient to make it clear to the air traffic controllers that they were almost out of gas.

"Malcolm Gladwell writes very interesting and entertaining books. J.R.R. Tolkein writes very interesting and entertaining books as well. However, after reading Tolkein, I did not venture out into the world in search of hobbits, dwarves and elves to be my new friends, or worry about being attacked by trolls. Tolkein's books, while entertaining, have little connection to reality. Unfortunately, the same can be said about Gladwell. ""Outliers"" is a series of well-written and interesting essays along the lines of New Yorker or Vanity Fair  articles. However, their connection with reality is highly, highly dubious.This book is a big disappointment after ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink"", both interesting books that don't have the reader arguing with the author the entire way through. One main problem is that there isn't really an identifiable thesis in the book. It seems like Gladwell wants to say that the myth of the ""self-made"" person is not true, since every successful person has had help and lucky breaks along the way. Well, duh! But then he goes on to say that successful people spend 10,000 hours on their chosen area of success. Do they get any credit for that? Does working on something for 10,000 hours when you could be goofing off make you a bit ""self-made""? In my book it certainly does.Take Bill Gates. Yes, he came from a rich family, had some breaks and some unique opportunities. But what about his former classmates who are now meth addicts or bitter failures who had similar opportunities, but didn't sieze them? Or those who simply were too lazy to put in 10,000 hours in front of the computer? Is Gates ""lucky"" that he had the drive to do that? So either the main thesis falls apart -- that if you are privileged and lucky you will be successful, or it becomes something completely prosaic, such as ""Gates worked hard, but he had some unique breaks"". Again, duh! That's life. Every person can identify positives and negatives in their own lives. It is the choice to overcome the negatives and to capitalize on the positives that makes the difference. If Gates hadn't found the computer lab Gladwell discusses, would he have just given up, or would he have kept on looking? I think that he would have kept looking until he found a similar opportunity.The science is also incredibly flimsy. He asserts - ""Successful hockey players are almost all born in January - March"". Well, wouldn't that apply to all athletes? Wouldn't somebody before Gladwell have figured that out? Where is the data from the NBA, NHL, NFL and MLB? It really is an example of inductive reasoning, not good science. Gladwell is made aware of a pattern with *certain* hockey teams in Canada, and then assumes that this small sample proves that if you are born in April or after, you won't become a good athlete. Maybe so, but Gladwell needs more data to prove his point.Another assertion is: ""Asians are good at math because their ancestors were rice farmers - They come from a patient, hard-working culture"". But perhaps there are other reasons that could explain the same thing: religious traditions, government, how education is structured. Hey, maybe Asians have a high tolerance for their own body odor and can spend more hours in the field than Europeans! I'm not seriously arguing that, but it is an example of Gladwell making a connection between two things that is far from proven.The book is best read as a series of colorful essays on some interesting topics. However, as a guide or explanation of success, it is an example of truly sloppy science and shoddy reasoning. True, successful people don't get there on their own. But everyone can review their lives and identify lucky breaks as well as unfair disadvantages. In the end, Gladwell doesn't explain success at all in a convincing fashion, and risks leaving the reader with the impression that fatalism is the only attitude to have towards their own success. Nothing could be further from the truth.",Outliers: by Malcolm Gladwell | The Story of Success | Summary & Takeaways,Malcolm Gladwell,1.0,0.067,0.744,0.189,0.9986,Positive,Somewhat Harmful,0.4148155152797699
"Outliers : the story of success, Malcolm Gladwell Outliers has been described as a form of autobiography, as Gladwell mixes in elements from his own life into the book to give it a more personal touch. Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers""--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different? His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «تافته های جدا بافته: داستان موفقیت»؛ «نخبگان چگونه نخبه میشوند»؛ «استثنایی ها: داستان موفقیت»؛ «قصه آدمهای استثنایی: توفیق از نگاهی دیگر»؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: پانزدهم ماه سپتامبر سال2010میلادیعنوان: تافته های جدا بافته: داستان موفقیت؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: میترا معتضد؛ تهران، نشر البرز، سال1388؛ چاپ دوم سال1389؛ در325ص؛ شابک9789644426797؛ موضوع: مهارتای کلیدی در کسب و کار و زندگی - موفقیت - مردمان موفق از نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده21معنوان: نخبگان چگونه نخبه میشوند؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: فرناز عسکری؛ فائزه عسکری؛ تهران، نشر سبزان، سال1389؛ در160ص؛ شابک9786005033984؛ چاپ دوم سال1389؛ چاپ سوم سال1393؛ عنوان: استثنایی ها: داستان موفقیت؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: محمدعلی سروری؛ تهران، نشر جمهوری، سال1389؛ در328ص؛ شابک9786005687170؛ عنوان: تافته جدا بافته: داستان موفقیت؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: سپیده علی کاشانی؛ تهران، نشر آنیسا، سال1393؛ در251ص؛ شابک9786009481408؛ عنوان: قصه آدمهای استثنایی: توفیق از نگاهی دیگر؛ نویسنده: مالکوم گلدول؛ مترجم: شهرزاد بیات موحد؛ کرج، نشر دُرَ دانش بهمن، سال1393؛ در305ص؛ شابک9789641740698؛بررسی زندگی غولهای تجارت، نابغه های علمی، ستارگان ورزشی، و موسیقیدانها؛ و اینکه آنها چه وجوه اشتراکی با هم دارند؛ به فراسوی نتایج چشمگیر، اسطوره ها و افسانه ها مینگرد، تا معلوم کند چه توضیح درستی برای اشخاص بسیار موفق وجود دارد؛ به پرسشهای زیر پاسخ میدهدضریب هوشی شما چه ربطی با میزان حقوقتان دارد؟ یک زبانشناس دربارة ایمنی خطوط هوایی چه چیزهایی میتواند به ما بگوید؟ طرز صحبت فرزند شما با یک بزرگسال چگونه بر موفقیت آنها در زندگی تاثیر میگذارد؟ شالیزارها چه ربطی به تبحر ریاضی دارند؟ و شما چگونه میتوانید یک فرد با استعداد و درخشان در ریاضی را بدون گرفتن آزمون شناسایی کنید؟ عنوانهای مطالب کتاب: «مقدمه: راز رزه‌تو»؛ «فصل اول: اثر متیو»؛ «فصل دوم: قانون10000ثانیه»؛ «فصل سوم: مشکل نابغه‌ها، قسمت اول»؛ «فصل چهارم:مشکل نابغه‌ها، قسمت دوم»؛ «فصل پنجم: سه درس از جو فلوم»؛ «فصل ششم: هارلن، کنتاکی»؛ «فصل هفتم: نظریه‌ قومی سقوط هواپیماها»؛ «فصل هشتم: شالیزارهای برنج و آزمون‌های ریاضی»؛ «فصل نهم: معامله ماریتا»؛ «فصل دهم: سخن آخر، یک داستان جامائیکایی»؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 13/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 20/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",Outliers: by Malcolm Gladwell | The Story of Success | Summary & Takeaways,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.003,0.92,0.077,0.9896,Positive,Somewhat Helpful,0.4381921589374542
"""This is not a book about tall trees. It's a book about forests.""""Why are manhole covers round?""This is my second Gladwell book - The Tipping Point being first - and after reading it, I'm still a little confused what to make of it. I originally thought this to be a self-improvement kind of book, but quickly figured that's not the case, then may be some sort of a business development one, which also fell apart quickly. I cannot round off this any closer than to some kind of a sociology - psychology combo.""the teachers are confusing maturity with ability.""""We prematurely write off people as failures.""I have to confess first, that I started reading this book with a lot of skepticism, mainly because of Peter Thiel's Zero to One. I liked that book a lot, and out of nowhere, Thiel attacks Gladwell in his book for being a negative influence on readers. But after reading the entire book now, I'm don't believe Thiel's criticisms are fully justified. Being said that, some of the concepts in outliers like 10,000 hour rule, though explained in a very clear and attractive manner, still seems a little bit out there. It's true that we are naturally reluctant to accept that certain unchangeable parameters in life to have any significant meaning towards our successes and failures in life, such as the birth month. It's kind of confusing how that kind of information suppose to help a person, unless of course the reader is purely interested in understanding such limitations and just accept them. This could indeed create a negative spiral of events, if someone embraces these limitations and give up on everything.""Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning.""Still, I have to give credit for how interestingly Gladwell interprets everything. If this is the first non-fiction or self-help book someone reads, it's easy to imagine that reader becoming a lifetime fan of Gladwell, for everything is laid out perfectly, in that unique Gladwell style. But read it with an open mind, and a tiny bit of skepticism, and you will come across some interesting interpretations of certain events. And finally, as to the concepts of outliers itself: obviously the environmental factors - both positive and negative - are going to impact any persons success or failures. It's interesting to see if there are any relationships or patterns in these factors, but, personally, I think it is a bit of a stretch. We should not let things like that affect the way we want to organize our lives. However, if one is purely interested in studying which environmental factors were important for a SELECTED FEW PERSONNEL in last century, this would be a good read. It might even go as far as to show you some hidden opportunities around you, how they managed to overcome their difficulties and how to utilize whatever resources available, and to provide some motivation.

"The term I've coined for books such as these is ""the illusion of erudition."" We love the anecdotes, many a form of comfirmation bias---the author telling us what we want to hear (cha-ching)---and we feel oh so much wiser once the wheels of the plane touch down on the runway at our destination because of having read a book such as this on our flight.====================================The famous, or infamous concept of the 10,000 ""rule"" in this book is not real. In a 2012 paper in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the lead author of the original study about the practice time of elite violinists, K. Anders Ericsson, ascribed the phrase’s popularity to a chapter title in Outliers, which, Ericsson wrote, “misconstrued” the conclusions of the violin study. Ericsson himself never used the number 10,000 or the term ""rule."" Gladwell made that up. Ericsson extended his study to sports. Author David Espstein reports on the results (next four paragraphs)....In fact, in absolutely every single study of sports expertise, there is a tremendous range of hours of practice logged by athletes who reach the same level, and very rarely do elite performers log 10,000 hours of sport-specific practice prior to reaching the top competitive plane, often competing in a number of other sports— and acquiring a range of other athletic skills— before zeroing in on one. Studies of athletes have tended to find that the top competitors require far less than 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to reach elite status. According to the scientific literature, the average sport-specific practice hours to reach the international levels in basketball, field hockey, and wrestling are closer to 2,000, 4,000, and 6,000, respectively. In a sample of Australian women competing in netball (sort of like basketball but without dribbling or backboards), arguably the best player in the world at the time, Vicki Wilson, had compiled only 600 hours of practice when she made the national team. A study of athletes on Australia’s senior national teams found that 28 percent of them started their sport at an average age of seventeen, having previously tried on average three other sports, and and debuted at the international level just four years later.Even in this age of hyperspecialization in sports, some rare individuals become world-class athletes, and even world champions, in sports from running to rowing with less than a year or two of training. As with studies of chess players, in all sports and skills, the only real rule is that there is a tremendous natural range.======The down side to the Gladwell ""rule"" is that you see many unhappy kids out there being ground through the requisite ""hours"" by parents hoping their children will get scholarships or maybe go pro. I've coached enough youth sports to know there needs to be some base talent to build on for a young person to excel. I've also seen many 12-year olds who were stars at that age, but who faded by age 16, no matter how many hours they put in. I've coached youth sports for years. I've seen this over and over.https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/op...===========At the gym one day, I ran into a varsity high school football coach, whose team had just won the California state championship. I asked him about ""the 10,000 rule.""He said: ""it's ruined many kids' lives.""70% of kids quit sports by age 13, many of them because “it’s not fun anymore.”==============More falsehood called out by The Sports Gene....""In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell makes a point about height in basketball by comparing it to IQ. There is a threshold, he writes, above which more does not really matter. Above an IQ of 120—which already eliminates most of humanity—he argues, one is already smart enough to consider the most difficult intellectual problems, and more IQ does not translate into real-world success. In basketball, he adds, “it’s probably better to be six two than six one . . . But past a certain point, height stops mattering so much.” But the “threshold hypothesis” of IQ is not supported by the work of scientists who specialize in that field, nor is the threshold hypothesis of NBA height supported by player data.""Does Gladwell do any real research or fact-checking? Apparently not. He can't be trusted. I guess he has some readers think they're geniuses if they have an IQ of 120.================It struck me that Gladwell is like a prosperity Gospel preacher who tells people what they want to hear. And uses anecdotes that supposedly prove his points.I saw a couple of minutes of the most famous such preacher in the U.S. right now, Joel Osteen, who holds forth in a retrofitted basketball stadium in Houston. He began with: ""God is faithful. That promotion you've been waiting for: it's just around the corner. That lifetime soulmate you've always been looking for is on the way to you right now. The bonus money you need to take a vacation: you'll get that check by Christmas.""Then he'll use some story, usually from the Old Testament, to illustrate. And throw in a couple of contemporary anecdotes. ""I met a man.....""What if these good things don't come true? The dark side is that you get blamed. Somehow you've incurred God's displeasure.So you got cut from the team? It must be because you only put in 9,500 hours of practice instead of 10,0000.======================The backstory on Gladwell...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...=========More parental insanity pushing kids to make parents proud....""Backyards feature batting cages, pitching tunnels, fencing pistes, Olympic-size hockey rinks complete with floodlights and generators. Hotly debated zoning-board topics include building codes for at-home squash courts and storm-drainage plans to mitigate runoff from private ice rinks. Whereas the Hoop Dreamers of the Chicago projects pursued sports as a path out of poverty and hardship, the kids of Fairfield County aren’t gunning for the scholarship money. It’s more about status maintenance, by any means necessary.""""Katie Andersen, who runs an Orange County, California–based college-advising company called College Fit, says that among the moral dilemmas the families she works with face is whether to come clean with a college coach about their kids’ multiple concussions. “Parents will be sitting in my office debating whether it makes sense to tell, and I want to scream.” Instead, she tries to play nice: “I say, ‘Can we please step back and think about your child? He’s had three concussions, multiple overuse injuries, multiple surgeries—and he’s playing soccer in college?

"Recommend to: If you like exploring phenomenon beyond their appearance and if you enjoy story-telling writings about factual subjects, here: successWhat this book is about: Here, the famous columnist, Malcolm Gladwell deeply investigates the topic of success and people or nations with far beyond average achievements whom he calls ""outliers"" to figure out what has contributed to their accomplishments.ProsThe way Gladwell observes and concludes is so enticing and far different from what you might think about why a phenomenon has happened. For example, see how these arguments might sound: 1. Chinese are good at math because of their way of sowing and reaping rice in the fields. 2. The flight number X crashed, because the co-pilot was Colombian. And any other Colombian in his place might have led to the very same outcome. Strange? Yes, is seems so, and Malcolm nicely shows how these seemingly unrelated events are tightly bound.So from the point of the way he see's things differently and actually tries to find real reasons behind events you'll find the book amusing and thought provoking.ConsThere are two major problems I have with this book. First, he nicely let’s say detects the roots from which success is grown and these roots he argues, are all mainly what we can have no part on cultivating or choosing. Things like the date of birth (which opens up opportunities for practice in cases he studies etc.), or cultural background. But it would have been much nicer had he provided vivid guidelines on now that we can't choose the roots, how we can provide the opportunities and the environment caused by the roots.The other problem with some of his observations is that they can be potentially badly flawed or be results of what scientists say clustering. Namely, you look at a particular area with particular trends and specifications and you extend the qualities to the whole group in other areas. Or in situations I think, despite his keen observation and uncovering an aspect of an event, fails to see other dimensions as well. For example, in one part he says “Because of the limitation of lands in china, farmers had to be smarter and work smarter on their lands to increase production in contrast with their counterparts in America who used advanced machinery to increase the harvest and productivity. Now my argument: Haven't the Americans been smart to build such advanced machineries? :| All in all  the book was often engaging and thought provoking and if you want to read it, have it read skeptically, for the book if not absorbed well because of the amount of emphasis he seemingly puts on chance (things we have no will to choose on our own like parents, birthday, cultural background, etc.) might end up discouraging. The book's message though I think is noble, really noble, which tries to tell that communities and societies are responsible for provisioning an environment in which members can fulfill their potentials. Oh by the way, the famous 10000 hours rule for mastery is the result of the Swedish psychologist Anders Ericsson studies and was merely popularized, by Malcolm Gladwell.",Outliers: by Malcolm Gladwell | The Story of Success | Summary & Takeaways,Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.07,0.777,0.153,0.9923,Positive,Somewhat Helpful,0.46530044078826904
"Here's what I wrote earlier. I have to admit to the more I think and talk about the book, the less I think of it. It all seems too superficial.A pretty interesting book, albeit with not quite as many ""knock me over with a feather"" moments as Blink. It starts off with a bang, as he discusses amateur hockey teams and how it was noticed that virtually all the players on an Under-18 hockey team came from the first three months of the year. Turns out the age cutoff is January 1 in Canada, so the older players (those born early in the year) advanced further due to their slight maturity advantage which continued to multiply, as they got better training, put on better teams etc.This subject hits close to home, as I am a soccer coach and heavily involved in my daughter's soccer league. My oldest has a birthday at the worst possible time, just a few weeks before the cutoff date, while the younger one has a birthday the month after the cutoff date. So far, it hasn't seemed to slow the older one's progress, but it is something I will certainly keep an eye on. Gladwell's suggestion is to have multiple cutoff dates, so other ages can play against others of the same age. Doesn't seem likely though.He also explores how the timing of your interests can really change things. Something as simple as how available computer time was to early pioneers like Bill Gates and Bill Joy. Certainly, in the late 60s and early 70s, the amount of keyboard time these guys had pales in comparison to what would be available just a few years before that. He also talks about a major law firm in New York that benefited from getting the kinds of financial cases the other law firms wouldn't deal with, only to explode in popularity as the money days of the 80s and 90s struck.I thought the book felt like it suffered from data mining, in that there didn't seem to be enough exploration of other equally successful groups that may not have had the same advantages.

Like the Italian community in Pennsylvania where people are healthier and live longer because they have a sense of “community” or the fact that Southerners react more violently to certain situations than Northerners because they derive from a “culture of honor.” Sounds like extrapolated horseshit to me, especially considering the sample size.

Like the fact that success breeds success, opportunity is key, practice pays off, etc. One of the few things I do find interesting, however, are differences noted in the way children are raised and the fact that some degree of entitlement being taught to them early can actually be beneficial as they mature into adulthood, mostly because they’d be able to use this sense of entitlement to demand higher salaries and better job positions.Regardless, this was my first experience skimming.

"Outliers. Or as it should be called, ""Outliers don't exist."" I not only couldn't put it down, but my wife feels like she's read it now too. It starts with a story about a town whose inhabitants only ever die from old age (i.e., not from cancer or ANY OTHER problem) and quickly goes into a story about hockey players in Canada.For some reason the best hockey players are born in January through March and rarely any time after. The reason - it's all because of the date of the cut-off for playing hockey in the junior leagues (I use that meaning ""for little guys first playing"" not because it is in any way accurate as to the actual name). Because the cut-off date for kids joining the hockey league is January 1, those born right after have to wait about a year to join. What happens when one kids plays against another who is a year older? They get slaughtered (in only a sports sense ... I hope). That year makes a difference to the little guys (and girls) and so they get to play on the advanced team, they get to be an all-star and therefore, they get more and more playing time. What starts out as an arbitrary date, turns into something real since those who get more playing time actually become better and end up making up the majority of the professionals. This strikes a particular cord with me, being a December birthday. Luckily I've never had the desire to become a professional hockey player ... or lived in Canada (not a Canada slight, I love you guys eh!).Anyway, this book is filled with stories like this, making the point that when it seems like someone is a unique and even a prodigy, it usually is because of way more factors than just they worked hard and they are smart.From Mozart to Bill Gates and even geniuses who never made a mark on society. To airplane copilots who rather than speak up about a problem, lead the plane directly into a mountain. To the fact that there really isn't a magical type of person who becomes great, but someone who can put in the right amount of practice to do so (10,000 hours to be exact). But then again, you have to be blessed with the ability to have those hours of practice rather than being forced to survival.His main point is that societies and culture and even timing (like birth) make up a lot of who people are and why they become ""outliers."" That an outlier doesn't really exist because it's a person who is a product of their surroundings. A good portion of the richest people throughout history were born within 9 years of each other, just in time to take advantage of the industrial revolution. This is an extremely eye-opening book that comes highly recommended. I couldn't stop thinking about it or talking about it and I already have another of his books, Blink, ready in the queue. The only criticism I can make is that as with most arguments, those that aren't as advantageous to his claims are left in the background a bit. He says that the timing of birth is a factor and I certainly think so, but it's also because of one or two of those people born that the next big shift in society happens and I don't think that can be ruled out.

"" اگر شما فقیر باشی و فراغت کافی برای زمان گذاشتن در اون زمینه بخصوص رو نداشته باشی،اگر محیط زندگی شما اون امکانات لازم برای انجام تمرین رو در اختیار شما قرار نداده باشه،یا اگر جامعه مثل بازیکنان هاکی، طی یک فرایند اتوماتیک، شما رو از انجام این میزان تمرین محروم کنه،شما نخواهی توانست به موفقیت برسی. حتی اگر استعداد ذاتی و ژنتیکی اون در شما باشه. کتاب با بررسی لیستی از ثروتمندترین افراد جهان نکته‌ای رو به چشم ما میاره. اینکه حدود 20 درصد از ثروتمندترین افراد کل تاریخ جهان (یعنی با معادل سازی از زمان مصر باستان تا به امروز)، متولد آمریکا طی سال‌های 1830 تا 1840 هستن.  بسیار تامل برانگیزه که ببینیم چه اتفاقی افتاده. مساله اینه که این افراد طی سالهای 1860 تا 1870 که اوج شکوفایی اقتصادی آمریکا هست، در سن مناسب و در جای مناسب قرار گرفتن. اینها همون افرادی بودن که در زمانی که شرایط اقتصادی مهیا شده بود، اون 10 هزار ساعت کار و مهارت رو اندوخته بودن و کاملا مستعد به موفقیت رسیدن بودن.مخلص کلام اینکه، موفقیت یک رخداد اجتماعیه. همونطور که ما پیدایش آتش رو به شخص خاصی نسبت نمی‌دیم (اگرچه واقعا اولش یک نفری بوده که بار اول آتیش رو کشف کرده) موفقیت‌های افراد مختلف، نتیجه محیط پیرامون افراد و به نوعی بخشی از نظام طبیعی و اجتماعی انسان‌هاست. درسته که همه متولدین سه ماهه اول سال وارد لیگ حرفه‌ای هاکی کانادا نمی‌شن و فقط اونهایی که ممارست و تلاش زیادی انجام می‌دن به این موفقیت نائل می‌شن، اما نکته بسیار کلیدی اینه که درک کنیم همه کسانی که سخت کار می‌کنن و ممارست زیادی بخرج می‌دن به موفقیت نمی‌رسن. برای موفقیت بسترهایی لازمه که باید جامعه اون رو در اختیار شما قرار بده. چون همونطور که گفتیم، موفقیت یک رخداد اجتماعیه.",Outliers: by Malcolm Gladwell | The Story of Success | Summary & Takeaways,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral,Somewhat Helpful,0.3798367977142334

How do some people achieve more, while others don’t even get the opportunity?The fascinating analysis of the American Football(Rugby) team gave me a new way to look at the system. Most American Football players are born in the first 5 months of a calendar year. Coincidence?I bet not. I don’t want to spoil the fun, read the book to know more.  The author tells numerous true stories of what appear to be shining examples of disadvantaged people who ended up being outstanding success stories. But then the author goes back through the same story and  takes a look at where that person came from and shows that they benefited from a combination of cultural background and a set of unique opportunities and timing that allowed them to succeed.Some of his best books are:1. The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (discusses the dynamics of social change)2. Outliers: The Story of Success (discusses the subject of success) 3.

"""Outliers"" those wildly successful people, for whom 'normal rules don't apply.' Are they just lucky, talented? Maybe...but, outliers may not be outliers after all...after reading the entire book, I was slapped by that at the very end. Gladwell looks closely at success, and those who seem to have waltzed into incredible success...Canadian hockey players, who just happened to have been born in the right month of the year; Bill Gates, who just happened to go to a school where the PTA moms bought a new-fangled computer system. Mozart, who didn't hit his stride until ten years after he began composing...the Beatles! Their sound was born of the 10,000 hours of performing in Hamburg -- more than other groups could amass in years of playing.Success is timing, and hard work...10,000 hours of practice required. It's luck -- having the right family, having the right opportunities -- Gladwell's description: ""a combination of ability, opportunity, and utterly arbitrary advantage...beneficiaries or some kind of unusual opportunity.""Gladwell's storytelling is so easy to fall into. We go with him anywhere...to a small town in Italy, to his own Jamaican family, and everywhere in between. I know Gladwell has an essay in TELLING TRUE STORIES, about narrative journalism, and I enjoyed reading this, more aware of the craft he practices...nonfiction storytelling.When Bill Gates admits he was very lucky, Gladwell hammers home that point.

"Gladwell is taking a lot of heat for biasing the examples he chooses in his books to make points that are often later shown to be somewhat tenuous. That may be the case, but he is a heck of a writer. He knows how to tell a compelling story and the conversations he sparks go on for years. Whatever harm that may come from the lack of rigorousness in his brand of pop-psychology is easily overshadowed by the positive cultural impact that comes from people giving serious consideration to his ideas and how they apply to their personal lives and to society on a larger scale. As with any book, don't read it passively, decide what you buy and what needs to be further examined. Enjoy it, it's a fun read.[Update]I came across a cool and relevant quote in The Tell-Tale Brain by V. S. Ramachandran from Darwin's The Descent of Man:""...false facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for everyone takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and when this is done, one path toward errors is closed and the road to truth is often at the same time opened.""","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.07,0.76,0.171,0.9766,Positive,,
"I think everyone heard my jaw drop. Much like a born again who reads the bible for the first time, I have never been able to relate to a book as well as with David & Goliath.Disclosure: I'm a dyslexic who spent all of his youth struggling through school -- spending my lunches tirelessly improving my spelling while everyone else spent their lunch break improving their rest. Things turned out all right, I was one of the first dyslexics at my school to graduate with an International Baccalaureate diploma and to receive the award for Extended Essay (the longest and most time consuming piece an 18-year-old writes). And then recently I wrote a piece on my blog about criminal systems in Europe and America. It was a personal project which led me through months of research and reflection. I titled it, ""To punish is to promote: How criminal justice systems can encourage crime"" and came to the conclusion that in some instances punishment may actually have the opposite effect intended. In other words, I realized the limits of power. So then to read Gladwell's David & Goliath was more than just an experience I could understand but completely relate with. It was so empowering to know I wasn't alone, that there were many more remote misses fighting to be just as good as everyone else in school and ending up with skills no class can teach. If you haven't read David & Goliath you won't really understand what I'm speaking about. But I'd encourage everyone to read it. It will make you realize that there's no such thing as simple, black and white. There's grey. There's yellow, blue, pink, orange, you name it. It will allow you to understand that for every difficult hardships life will throw at you you'll learn skills everyone else will wish they had.

"The Art of Avoiding Bestsellers: A Field Guide for Authors
How do books succeed?By getting into the Bestseller lists? By making a few millions? By winning the most prestigious awards of the day?Wrong.These are very narrow views on what constitutes success for a work of art, especially literature or serious non-fiction. If we redefine success, we might find that these very things that confers ‘success’ in the short term might be hurting the artist/author the most in the long term. This applies to prestigious prizes such as Bookers as well, as we will see. We might even get an idea of why so few of the Booker winning books seem to be good enough a few years after their moment of glory. (Spoiler: They cater to the jury and the prevailing standards of judgement, which may become old too soon.)+++Let us illustrate this by taking an example from this very book. This reviewer has to warn the reader that the example is originally invoked in the book for another purpose though it has been adopted more or less verbatim here, but we need to get into that now. (By the way, the careful reader should also be able to divine why this small essay is can also serve as a review for this book in particular and to all of Mr. Gladwell’s books in general.)Let us go back to 19th century France. Art was a big deal in the cultural life of France back then. Painting was regulated by the government and was considered a profession in the same way that medicine or the law is a profession today. The Professionals who did well would win awards and prestigious fellowships. And at the pinnacle of the profession was The Salon, the most important art exhibition in all of Europe.+++Every year each of the painters of France submitted two or three of his finest canvases to a jury of experts, bringing their work to the 
Palais de l’Industrie
, an exhibition hall built for the Paris World Fair between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine. Throughout the next few weeks, the jury would vote on each painting in turn. Those deemed unacceptable would be stamped with the red letter “R” for rejected. Those accepted would be hung on the walls of the Palais, and over the course of six weeks beginning in early May, as many as a million people would throng the exhibition. The best paintings were given medals. The winners were celebrated and saw the value of their paintings soar - became ‘bestsellers’. The losers limped home and went back to work.“There are in Paris scarcely fifteen art-lovers capable of liking a painting without Salon approval,” Renoir once said. “There are 80,000 who won’t buy so much as a nose from a painter who is not hung at the Salon.”The Salon was the most important art show in the world. In short, for a painter in nineteenth-century France, the Salon was everything - the Booker Committee and the Bestseller List rolled into one.+++And now, the twist:In spite of the all the benefits, the acceptance by the Salon also came with a large cost: for the truly creative and path breaking (let us take for example the Impressionists such as Monet, which is the case study taken up by the book):1. It required creating the kind of art that they did not find meaningful,2. & They risked being lost in the clutter of other artists’ work. Was it worth it?The Salon was the place where reputations were made. And what made it special was how selective it was. There were roughly three thousand painters of “national reputation” in France in the 1860s, and each submitted two or three of his best works to the Salon, which meant the jury was picking from a small mountain of canvases. Rejection was the norm. Getting in was a feat. “The Salon is the real field of battle,” Manet said. “It’s there that one must take one’s measure.”  It was the place where “you could succeed in making a noise, in defying and attracting criticism, coming face-to-face with the big public.”But the very things that made the Salon so attractive—how selective and prestigious it was—also made it problematic.No painter could submit more than three works. The crowds were often overwhelming. The Salon was the Big Pond. But it was very hard to be anything at the Salon but a Little Fish.+++Night after night, the rebels (the Impressionists) argued over whether they should keep knocking on the Salon door or strike out on their own and stage a show just for themselves. Did they want to be a Little Fish in the Big Pond of the Salon or a Big Fish in a Little Pond of their own choosing?The problem for the rebels such as the Impressionists was The Salon’s attitude: it was cautious, traditional. It had a reputation to uphold for being the voice of approval. It could not afford to make mistakes.“Works were expected to be microscopically accurate, properly ‘finished’ and formally framed, with proper perspective and all the familiar artistic conventions,” the art historian Sue Roe writes. “Light denoted high drama, darkness suggested gravitas. In narrative painting, the scene should not only be ‘accurate,’ but should also set a morally acceptable tone. An afternoon at the Salon was like a night at the Paris Opéra: audiences expected to be uplifted and entertained. For the most part, they knew what they liked, and expected to see what they knew.”The kinds of paintings that won medals, Roe says, were huge, meticulously painted canvases showing scenes from French history or mythology, with horses and armies or beautiful women, with titles like Soldier’s Departure, Young Woman Weeping over a Letter, and Abandoned Innocence.The Impressionists, on the other hand, had an entirely different idea about what constituted art.They painted everyday life. Their brushstrokes were visible. Their figures were indistinct. To the Salon jury and the crowds thronging the Palais, their work looked amateurish, even shocking, and was repeatedly turned down. They had no hope of making waves in the Big Pond of The Salon.+++The Big Fish–Little Pond GambitPissarro and Monet were smarter. They conjured up an alternative to the shackles of the Salon.They thought it made more sense to be a Big Fish in a Little Pond. If they were off by themselves and held their own show, they said, they wouldn’t be bound by the restrictive rules of the Salon, where the medals were won by paintings of soldiers and weeping women. They could paint whatever they wanted. And they wouldn’t get lost in the crowd, because there wouldn’t be a crowd.In 1873, Pissarro and Monet proposed that the Impressionists set up a collective called the Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs. There would be no competition, no juries, and no medals. Every artist would be treated as an equal.The Impressionists’ exhibition opened on April 15, 1874, and lasted one month. The entrance fee was one franc. There were 165 works of art on display, including three Cézannes, ten paintings by Degas, nine Monets, five Pissarros, six Renoirs, and five by Alfred Sisley—a tiny fraction of what was on the walls of the Salon across town. In their show, the Impressionists could exhibit as many canvases as they wished and hang them in a way that allowed people to actually see them.This was the first exhibition of ""Impressionism"". It was here that Critic Louis Leroy took the title of a work by Monet, 'Impression, Sunrise' to deride exposure and then went on to qualify these artists, quite skeptically, as ""Impressionists.""The name stuck.+++This historic show brought the artists some critical attention. Not all of that attention was positive: one joke (in addition to the name 'impressionism' itself!) told was that what the Impressionists were doing was loading a pistol with paint and firing at the canvas.But that was the second part of the Big Fish–Little Pond bargain. The Big Fish–Little Pond option might be scorned by some on the outside, but Small Ponds are welcoming places for those on the inside. They have all of the support that comes from community and friendship—and they are places where innovation and individuality are not frowned upon.“We are beginning to make ourselves a niche,” a hopeful Pissarro wrote to a friend. “We have succeeded as intruders in setting up our little banner in the midst of the crowd.” Their challenge was “to advance without worrying about opinion.” He was right. Off by themselves, the Impressionists found a new identity. They felt a new creative freedom, and before long, the outside world began to sit up and take notice.In the history of modern art, there has never been a more important or more famous exhibition. If you tried to buy the paintings in that warren of top-floor rooms today, it would cost you more than a billion dollars.+++In the end, the Impressionists were lucky to make the right choice, which is one of the reasons that their paintings hang in every major art museum in the world. But this same dilemma comes up again and again, and often the choice made is not as wise.Their story should remind today’s top artists and authors that there is a point at which money and mainstream recognition stop making them and start breaking them. The story of the Impressionists suggests that when the artists/authors strive for the best and attach great importance to getting into the Bestseller lists and Booker Lists, rarely do they stop and consider—as the Impressionists did—whether this is always in their best interest:1. One of the important lessons the Impressionists could teach the modern artists is that there are times and places where it is better to be a Big Fish in a Little Pond than a Little Fish in a Big Pond, where the apparent disadvantage of being an outsider in a marginal world turns out not to be a disadvantage at all.2. Another important lesson is that what counts in the end is if you let the Big Pond define you, or if you were brave enough to invent an alternative. The answer might not always be a Little Pond, but it sure can’t be meek acceptance of the current status quo path either.Think of all the great artists of the modern age who could hardly be defined as mainstream during their own lifetimes, who would never dream of writing for the approval of a committee, who were as far away from honors and awards and money as only exiles could be.Think of all the books with prestigious honors and the #1 bestseller mark that seem like jokes now.Think about how so many of our best authors seem to end up producing the same sort of exceptional trash - very well written, but hardly the real deal that would last a century.+++What then can be an alternative for the ones who want to break free? We can talk about one option that our case study suggests - it might not be the only option, and the creative ones can always come up with better option, but the exhortation of this reviewer is a simple one: that the really ambitions artists and authors need to start thinking hard about the best use of their own abilities and efforts.(Added here from the comments section, for clarity):To restate, in our day the artists have three options -1. Satisfy the Bank2. Satisfy the critics (or impress)3. Or satisfy their own genius (or impress)The last being the most risky and perhaps most important one.So what is the winning option again? For one thing, examples abound of niche novelists’ groups pushing the boundaries of literature, slowly attaining cult status and eventually becoming part of the canon itself. Just as Pissarro, Monet, Renoir, and Cézanne weighed prestige against visibility, selectivity against freedom, and decided the costs of the Big Pond were too great, it is time for the really serious to make the same call, of rejecting the conventional trappings of ‘success’ that only serves to limit their possibilities.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,2.0,0.057,0.781,0.162,0.9998,Positive,,
"No-one does insight porn quite as well as Malcolm Gladwell. His technique has been fairly well analysed before, and, with the publication of “David and Goliath” is currently under the spotlight again (e.g. http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/m... and http://blog.chabris.com/2013/10/why-m...). Even though much of the backlash often falls directly into the same traps of which he gets accused (e.g. critics cherry-picking the parts of his books that best support their complaints), the key argument is generally quite valid: Gladwell takes a minority, slightly counter-intuitive, perspective, highlights some evidence that possibly supports it, and ignores alternative readings of the same stories, and all the evidence for different positions.The key question is: how much does this matter?One of the central concepts in this book is that of the inverted U-curve — where an increase in something is valuable for a while, but then starts to become a negative (e.g. drinking some alcohol is good for your health, but drinking too much causes problems.) Gladwell applies this to numerous other areas, from teacher–student ratios, or the relationship between wealth and parenting, through to punishment for crimes. But one question not asked in this book, or any review I've seen of it so far, is whether Gladwell's own brand of pop-science might have exactly the same curve, and whether he might actually now be at the wrong end of it. This book contains two extended discussions on topics I know quite a lot about (the conflict in Northern Ireland, and the interpretation of the Biblical story of David and Goliath). In each there's an existing dominant narrative that is largely flawed. But directly attacking a dominant narrative generally has little effect (indeed, often simply reinforces it). A more effective approach to countering a position with which you disagree, and one that Gladwell is a master of, is to simply tell a better story with a different narrative. (There has been significant research on this area in recent years, particularly with respect to political debate, but there's also a long history of this in theology too, in the battles between heresy and orthodoxy.)On the left-hand side of the inverted U-curve, this is a very valuable function. Handled well this approach stimulates thinking and debate and, hopefully, leads to a deeper and more nuanced general understanding of the area. But this relies on arriving at a synthesis of both positions. The key problem with Gladwell, it seems to me, is that he's simply too good at what he does. He's such a superb story-teller that people read his books and come away convinced of his positions, accepting his narrative as being the complete truth itself, rather than simply as a valuable contribution to a wider debate and understanding.But I'm unconvinced that this is a flaw with his books and columns themselves. They're doing a very precise thing, and doing it very well. And this one is no exception. It's a delight to read, and raises a lot of very interesting and valuable questions. And those who wish to challenge the answers it offers would do well to learn from the approach, and start telling better stories themselves.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.073,0.755,0.171,0.9957,Positive,,
"Now, there is a lot of skepticism about Gladwell and his research methods, but whether he self-selects his data or whatever, I think that the very nature of his writing indicates that his research isn't totally conclusive. So why bother reading him? Well, Gladwell, whether he's a legitimate social scientist(or whatever the term is) or not, is a pretty gifted writer. He has a knack for telling stories and presenting dry information, like statistics, in a compelling way. Plus, his theories are always provoking, if not convincing.I like to read Gladwell as more of a short story collector rather than reading his books as though they prove a single theory about humanity and how we live. Taking his chapters in isolation, he uses the form of the case study to advance some interesting ideas and I don't always agree with him.So if we think of David and Goliath as a collection of case studies that loosely revolve around a particular theme (power, the myth of advantage, and the underdog-something Gladwell is particularly obsessed by), several chapter are capable of provoking conversation such as his chapter on class sizes. Using a high school that can have classes as small as 12 kids, Gladwell talks about the ""too much of a good thing"" danger and succeeds in making us realize that small class sizes are not the golden solution to America's education problem and are not necessarily a good thing...but then he totally disrupts that train of thought when he validly mentions that a drop in class sizes across the board resulted in no appreciable gain because teachers weren't adapting their teaching methods.It seems to me that in his work there is always this give and take. He gives you an idea and some evidence to back it up...and then throws in some parallel story that either invalidates the first point or is completely irrelevant. For instance, he takes the founder of the Three Strikes Law and talks about the tragic circumstances that led to the law's genesis. He then talks about the problems of the law, weaves in some stuff about legitimate power and how cracking down harder on criminals is nonsense using Northern Ireland's history and a specific neighborhood in New York. At this point, I'm totally with it. But then he throws in a story that's meant to parallel Reynold's story-a family in Canada whose daughter is kidnapped and then years later found dead and subsequent investigations lead to the murderer being apprehended- and then talks about how this Canadian family chooses not to use their daughter's case to bring about change of the legal system..and attributes this to their Mennonite background. The overall effect is that it leaves the reader kind of confused and adds nothing to this underdog defeating the giant theme. These kinds of problems occur throughout the entire book and the ending leads one to wonder...what exactly was the point of all that, Gladwell?Added to the fact that much of this book seems to deal with stuff that's way too similar to the ground he covered with  Outliers , I'd only recommend this book to teachers looking for excerpts to use to provoke criticality about bias and research or using excerpts to introduce an idea about power, justice, etc.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,2.0,0.138,0.786,0.076,-0.9899,Negative,,

"This guy writes so well. He draws you in with beautifully crafted stories. Murnane says in one of his books that he regretted having told people that some of his books were works of fiction and some essays. I really believe that creativity is essential for both these writing tasks, and that because real art prefers to hide, there is a good argument to be had in believing that more creativity is asked for in the writing of non-fiction than in fiction.Not that this guy really hides his artifice. His stories are painstakingly structured and his punches are delivered with such precision that it is hard not to want to applaud even as they slam into the side of your face.And I love that he leads me down the garden path. I wonder how many people will be caught in the depths of their prejudices only to find the tables being turned. It would be hard to make a more compelling argument, for instance, in favour of the Californian ‘three strikes and your in’ laws than he makes here or to find a way to so convincingly refute this emotional, logical and compelling argument almost immediately after.This book was infinitely confronting for me. If I was paranoid then I would have to assume Gladwell had gone out of his way to find every topic I find almost unbearable to think about – that somehow he had written this book as part of a bizarre vendetta against me. I’ve explained my problems with dyslexia before - https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... - so want go through that again other than to say that I found this part of the book really hard going. I wouldn’t wish dyslexia on my worst enemy – shame and humiliation are not toys to be played with. As you can also see in that review, I’m from Belfast and left just before the Troubles started. That Gladwell discusses the internment here was and is and will always be like an open wound for me – my childhood consisted of hearing stories of rubber bullets fired into crowds of protestors and spent singing songs about armoured cars and tanks and guns that came to take away our sons, of collective punishments meted out by unfeeling monsters and of whole populations being guilty because they were Irish. Parts of this book held a mirror up to all of the things that made me feel different and odd and out of place in my childhood, all of the things that held me apart, and those things never really leave you, even if you haven’t thought about them for years.And if you want to make me full of an unquenchable fury, then talk of collaborators with the Nazis turning in Jews so they can to be transported to the death camps. Or of people refusing to buy clothes because a black person may have touched them. Or of black children being arrested and ‘checked for venereal disease’ as a means of humiliating them for asking for justice, for having to ask for what ought to have been theirs’ by birth right.And the worst of my nightmares are here too. I am a father of two daughters. This book was written to torture people like me. Torture us by showing our nightmares made real, lived out in the lives of people we would empathise with, but Gladwell forces from us more than merely our empathy, he places us in their shoes – he has us holding the hands of our own daughters as they lay dying or has us wait months to learn of their slow death by torture. I let very few writers take me to those places.This book has opened and scattered salt across virtually every wound and every scar, real and imagined, of which my life is constituted. All the same, read it. This isn’t a pleasant read by any stretch of the imagination, this isn’t something which is fun – but you’ll remember this book and it will make you think and it will make you feel – and there’s not much else to ask from books.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.106,0.835,0.059,-0.9698,Negative,,
"What an excellent storyteller. I love his mind. I was smiling a lot. It’s stimulating. These things are fun to think about.Not everything he says is irrefutable fact. Some of his information is anecdotal. But he raises good questions. I think what he says is true, even though opposite or different views may be true. Some topics were a little slow, but I was frequently delighted and fascinated.MY FAVORITE TOPICS:The story of David and GoliathLess talented basketball players can win using full court press.The best class size for one teacher was 29. Too small, 9 was bad. The reason is students had more peers. There was more interaction, dialogue, and energy among the students. A class size of 36 was too large to be good.Two brilliant and talented students got into top colleges: a science major at Brown and a math major at Harvard. After two years they were so disheartened and disappointed that they switched to less rigorous majors. The reason is they were surrounded by so many bright minds, they felt average or below average in those fields. If they had gone to second tier schools, they would have been at the top of their classes and probably not changed majors.Dr. Jay Freireich lacked empathy for his patients - children with leukemia. Therefore, he was willing to experiment with painful and dangerous procedures for these children - things other doctors were unwilling to do. Under the care of empathetic doctors, children died from leukemia. But they were cured by Dr. Freireich’s procedures of repeated cocktails of painful drugs and large needles taking frequent and painful bone marrow samples. It is suggested that his lack of empathy was caused by lack of parental nurturing and love when he was a child.Dyslexics developed abilities that brought them great success.OTHER TOPICS:Too much money creates parenting problems.Different types of fear and lack of fear during the WWII bombings in London.Civil rights movement in Birmingham AlabamaThe British and Protestants vs the Catholics in IrelandCalifornia’s three strikes and you’re out - jailing criminalsThe Huguenots in France protecting Jews during WWIII was pleased the author provided a PDF file that audiobook buyers could download. It has the picture of the dog attacking a black man in Alabama which he talked about. It also has charts and a few references.NARRATOR:The author narrated this book.

"This is classic Malcolm Gladwell: A bunch of enjoyable and entertaining case studies grouped loosely under a thought-provoking theme. This time his theory is that being the underdog and having disadvantages can actually be an advantage.The title comes from a biblical story about a giant warrior named Goliath who was slain by David, a shepherd boy who was good with a slingshot. Gladwell analyzes the story and determines that the boy was not, in fact, an underdog, but was actually was a skilled hunter, and that Goliath didn't stand a chance against him.My favorite discussions in the book were about education, including the popular-but-apparently-not-true belief that small class sizes are always better. There were also some good stories about choosing colleges, and students reading this may be surprised to learn that a high-ranking school (such as the Ivy League) may not always be the best option for your career. There was also a good discussion about dyslexia, and why having challenges to overcome could actually help motivate you to be more successful.I finished this book a few days ago, and it is already fading fast from my mind, something that always happens to me with Gladwell books. I find his writing pleasant and his ideas interesting, but the details don't always stick.

"Malcolm Gladwell is one of those authors who you remember reading, but may not quite recall which book a particular phrase came from. They're all pretty similar.But that's the beauty of Gladwell. He's developing a coherent canon and, really, do you want to be surprised all the time? The world is disconcerting enough already.The title, David and Goliath, tells you exactly what this book is about. It's about the little guy who made good and, even better, who turned his adversities into strengths. In Gladwellian fashion there are illustrative anecdotes - from short basketball players, to orphaned children, to anti-Nazi French villagers - that expand upon the idea of less can be more. Or following the sometimes Biblical headers in the book: The last shall be first.So why only three stars? Because Gladwell is that sort of author. Pretty predictable, but pretty good at it.

"I've never hidden my stigmatized identity as an academic social scientist who loves Malcolm Gladwell. Gladwell's books are routinely criticized by folks in my field for relying too heavily on anecdotes, conveniently selecting and interpreting supportive scientific studies, and imprecision/ overgeneralization. These points are valid, but I don't see them as damning. Gladwell isn't a scientist, and he's not writing textbooks. Ideally, he helps spark people's interest in research and makes them want to know more (and maybe less eager to de-fund science?). I enjoy getting swept up in Gladwell's story-telling and I like the way he weaves together a little research with a lot of engaging humanities / human-interest-type stuff. I don't always buy his arguments, and there's plenty to nit-pick, but I admire and enjoy his rhetorical style. His stories are juicy and memorable.David & Goliath is similar to Gladwell's previous trilogy of social science-y books. The theme here is situations where underdogs prevail and giants fail to benefit from their seemingly obvious advantages. As usual, the theme is diffuse and some of the stories are more germane, persuasive, or compelling than others. Still, I enjoyed taking the somewhat meandering, but also thought-provoking journey.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.07,0.709,0.221,0.9872,Positive,,
داود و جالوت با عنوان فرعی آدم های ضعیف، وصله های ناجور و هنر پیکار با غول ها کتابی ایست از مالکوم گلدول ، نویسنده کانادایی . او در این کتاب کوشیده مزایای ضعیف بودن در پیکار با غول ها و یا تیمهای قوی را بررسی کند. او از طیف گسترده‌ای از مطالعات ، از داستان کتاب مقدس داوود و جالوت تا تاریخ جنبش حقوق مدنی، یا مسابقه های بسکتبال برای اثبات فرضیه خود استفاده کرده است .جالب ترین مثالی که گلدول استفاده کرده ، همان پیکار داود ، جوانی چابک ، بدون سپر و زره با جالوت ، مردی قد بلند ، با زره ای بسیار سنگین است . در نگاه کلی ، این گونه به نظر می رسد که داود در برابر این غول بیابانی شانس چندانی ندارد اما گلدول نگاهی دقیق به جالوت و مکالمه او با داود انداخته . نویسنده از ظاهر غیرعادی جالوت نتیجه گرفته که احتمالا او به بیماری کند ذهنی مبتلا بوده که داود را به پیش آمدن و پیکار از روبرو تشویق می کرده ، همچنین او خوب هم نمی دیده و دوبینی و یا تاری دید هم داشته و تصور می کرده که داود چند شمشیر داشته . در برابر جالوت ، داود چوپانی چابک و سریع و فلاخن اندازی سخت ماهر بوده که با سنگ اندازی از راه دور گله خود را در برابر حیوانات وحشی ، حفظ می کرده است .با وجود مشکلات سخت جالوت ، داود در پیکاری متعارف با جالوت عملا هیچ گونه شانسی ندارد ، بنابراین تنها راه پیروزی او ، جنگیدن به سبک خود یعنی از راه دور است . این گونه و با این تغییر پارادایم ، جالوت هم نبرد را می بازد و هم سر خود را .گلدول از این مثال این گونه نتیجه می گیرد که افراد ضعیف و ناتوان هم گاهی اوقات ، مزیت هایی دارند ، برای نمونه آنها چون توسط حریفان خود دست کم گرفته می‌شوند ، این امر می‌تواند به آنها یک برتری روانی بدهد، زیرا حریفان آنها ممکن است کمتر آماده مبارزه با آنها باشند یا آنها اغلب از انگیزه بیشتری نسبت به رقبای خود برخوردارند. زیرا ممکن است برای هدفی که به آن اعتقاد دارند بیشتر و سخت تر مبارزه کنند و از همه مهمتر آنها اغلب خلاق‌تر و نوآورتر هستند ، زیرا نمی‌توانند به اندازه خود یا قدرت خود تکیه کنند بنابراین ، مجبور شوند مانند داود ، روش‌های جدیدی برای پیروزی پیدا کنند .گلدول نمونه های فراوانی ، از مسابقات ورزشی مانند بسکتبال ، تا افرادی که ضعف جسمی آنها سبب نشده که از مبارزه دست بکشند ، آورده . او در تمامی این مثال ها تقریبا نکاتی مشابه پیکار داود و جالوت را نتیجه گیری کرده است .نویسنده ، در پایان این درس ها را به زندگی روزمره هم تسری داده ، از نگاه او برای غلبه بر مشکلات ، باید از نقطه ضعف رقبا آگاه بود ، از استراتژی های جدید استفاده کرد و انعطاف پذیر بود .گلدول استدلال می کند که این گونه می توان بر معایب خود غلبه کرد و با کار سخت و فکر کردن خلاقانه ، افراد ضعیف و ناتوان هم توانایی انجام کارهای بزرگی را دارند.,"David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral,,
"David and Goliath opens, appropriately, with a discussion of the literal confrontation between David and Goliath, and how the conventional understanding that David was a massive underdog is precisely backwards. In fact, Goliath never stood a chance of defeating David (there are reasons). And Mr. Gladwell uses that story to lay out the two ideas he wants to examine. The first is that “the act of facing overwhelming odds produces greatness and beauty.” The second is that:[W]e consistently get these kinds of conflicts wrong. We misread them. We misinterpret them. Giants are not what we think they are. The same qualities that appear to give them strength are often the sources of great weakness.David and Goliath explores these ideas in a wide array of areas. As is usual in Mr. Gladwell’s books, there are discussions of psychological and social science research into various issues surrounding schools and parenting, learning disabilities and the differences between capitalization learning and compensation learning. There’s also a surprising amount of history here, ranging from the story of David and Goliath, to the impressionist masters of late-19th century France, to the Blitz and Vichy France, to the 1960s American Civil Rights movement. Indeed, the discussion of Londoners’ reaction to the Blitz, and how those who did not suffer direct hits or near misses soon began to feel a sense of invincibility from their remote misses, felt very prescient about how too many people reacted to the pandemic.Some of David and Goliath’s conclusions feel inescapably true, even if you find the examples used to illustrate them feel a bit forced. We do misjudge certain things as being advantages that really aren’t. Disadvantages do cause some people to develop other skills, become stronger, or give them the unexpected freedom of having nothing to lose. There are limits to power in that it must be seen as legitimate or else its will lead to backlash. Other ideas are more intriguing, even if ultimately unproven. When is it better to be a big fish in a little pond than a little fish in a big pond? How many things in this world are subject to the ideas of the law of diminishing returns and the inverted U curve?As always, Mr. Gladwell makes you reconsider what you thought you knew. David and Goliath may not always be completely persuasive, but it is another entertaining and thought-provoking read.

"I'm a Spock sort of person. I believe that everything in the universe is logical. If something appears to be illogical it is simply because our knowledge about it is lacking. Unlike Spock though I embrace a wider spectrum of what constitutes logic, eg emotions are very important and relevant....but otherwise I agree completely with his approach to life.This book is all about situations that don't look logical on the surface, but if you dig a little deeper you discover the logic. To that extent it reminds me slightly of Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything - a book I enjoyed enormously. It looks under the surface of things to discover what is really going on.Situations where the underdog does well are explored...some of these include:*David and Goliath. (It turns out David was not the underdog he at first appeared to be...)*The surprising emotional or intellectual strengths that can result from a childhood where loss or scarcity have been experienced.... eg poverty, the loss of a parent, or the experience of dyslexia. Obviously a constructive outcome does not apply to everyone who has undergone these obstacles in life, but it does apply to a surprising number of people.*The importance of equality to levels of happiness. Sometimes very poor countries have a higher rating of happiness than richer countries, where there is greater disparity between people. It is not correct to automatically assume that the people in poorer countries are automatically more unhappy.*Small class sizes in schools are over-rated, sometimes bigger classes are better. (Though there is a cap on size too. Massive classes aren't helpful either.)*Unless you are an absolute genius, it is better to be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a big pond. This applies startlingly to universities. Go to Harvard at your peril.*The experiences of Martin Luther King and his supporters in Birmingham.*The shortcomings of the Three Strikes legal system in California, initiated by Mike Reynolds, whose daughter was murdered in 1992, versus a philosophy of forgiveness, as shown by a Mennonite called Wilma Derksen, whose daughter was also murdered.*The Troubles in Ireland, and how a march by a group of Catholic women managed to undermine the force of the British army.*The extraordinary courage of the people of Le Chambon in France, who sheltered Jewish people in World War 2, and how they managed to get away with it, despite the Germans being aware of what was going on.I found the book interesting, but a little 'bitty' (lots of short pieces about different things.) Some of the situations described interested me more than others, but this is probably only natural. I'm also not convinced of a philosophy of the strength of the underdog. Yes, sometimes it happens, and often it is great when it does, but there are millions of occasions where the winner takes all. There were some fascinating nuggets of information though, and all in all it was an enjoyable read.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Malcolm Gladwell's TED lecture on why David beat Goliathhttp://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_glad...The New York Times review of this book:http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/boo...","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.084,0.736,0.18,0.9954,Positive,,
"Malcolm Gladwell is notorious in certain circles for his brand of ""turns out"" pseudo-science writing. The typical structure look something like this: First, he lays out a topic about which there's a certain conventional wisdom. He then proceeds to explain, through a series of anecdotes backed loosely by scientific research, that it ""turns out"" that this conventional wisdom is incorrect. Outliers and The Tipping Point are two previous examples which I thoroughly enjoyed. This book follows that formula, but less successfully than his previous works.Overall, this book was very mediocre. If you thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's other books, you might consider reading this. Otherwise, I'd probably skip it - just read Outliers instead. Gladwell's books have always walked the line between thought-provoking and entertaining on one hand, and over-simplistic and strained on the other hand. This one fell on the wrong side of that line. The stories frequently managed to be entertaining and adequately told, but the link between the stories and the ideas they're supposed to illustrate are frequently far too flimsy to hold up under any kind of scrutiny. Portions of the book, particularly his direct deconstruction of the story of David and Goliath, are even painful to read. I'm not sorry that I read it, but I wouldn't recommend it highly to others.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,2.0,0.066,0.774,0.16,0.9629,Positive,,
"Malcolm Gladwell's books are all in the same style. Gladwell writes interesting anecdotes and then generalizes them, showing common themes, behaviors, or morals. Whether or not these generalizations are valid, his books are vastly entertaining, and this book is no exception. David and Goliath is perhaps the most entertaining book I read this year!In the introduction, Gladwell reviews the biblical story of David and Goliath. The popular conception is that Goliath was a mighty warrior, and David a meek shepherd who was clearly the underdog. Gladwell turns the story around, and by analyzing the biblical verses, he shows that David was not an underdog at all. He had a number of advantages that should have raised his odds of winning.This is the major theme of the book; many apparent disadvantages can turn out to be advantages, while many apparent advantages can turn out to be disadvantageous. Each chapter is a compendium of anecdotes from all spheres of life, that give evidence for this turnabout.Gladwell describes a father who volunteered to be a basketball coach for his daughter's team. Neither the father nor the girls had any experience with basketball. But because he was desperate, the father came up with an atypical strategy that turned the team into a powerhouse.Gladwell shows that although dyslexia is a learning disability, it can help mold a person. A person with dyslexia, given the right aptitudes, can overcome the handicap and excel where other people have lesser abilities. At a meeting of prominent university donors--mostly successful businesspeople, a neuroscientist asked how many had been diagnosed with a learning disorder. Half the hands went up.A medical doctor who had a terrible, traumatic childhood developed a cure for childhood leukemia. Other doctors with normal childhoods were too squeamish to experiment and find such a cure.Gladwell shows that ultra-small class sizes are not always advantageous. Selective, elite schools are not necessarily good for all the students--they might only be good for those students at the very top of the class. He wrote that ""...if you want to see the positive effects of elite schools on self-concept, you are measuring the wrong person. You should be measuring the parents.""The chapter about elite schools follows up with a very interesting observation, that it is better to be a big fish in a ""small pond"" than a little fish in a ""big pond"". As evidence for this, Gladwell cites statistics about college students completing a STEM degree (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). He writes that ""the likelihood of a student completing a STEM degree rises by 2 percentage points for every 10-point decrease in the university's average SAT score."" If you are in a university where many people seem to be smarter than you, it is more likely that you will drop out of a challenging curriculum.Gladwell writes about the apprehension in London before the expected bombing blitz by the Nazis. Courage is not something that you already have that makes you brave when the tough times start. Courage is what you earn when you've been through the tough times and you discover they aren't so tough after all. He shows how the Germans thought that the bombing would traumatize the city. Instead, it made the British more courageous than ever before.I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in psychology, as a fast, entertaining look at human behavior.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.082,0.78,0.138,0.9871,Positive,,
"I wrote about my Malcolm Gladwell ambivalence in my What the Dog Saw review. Reading Gladwell has become, for me, the literary equivalent of eating Cheetos or listening to Coldplay - I unequivocally enjoy the experience, but in a vaguely unsatisfying way and I wouldn't want anyone to catch me doing it. His rhetorical stock-in-trade is the reassessment of received wisdom about human behavior examined with respect to such organizing topics as trends, decision-making, success and, in this instance, perceived relative advantage in apparently mismatched conflicts. David and Goliath's argument gets off to a rather clumsy start with a creakily literal-minded 'historical' analysis of the titular metaphor. Gladwell is right about the ubiquity and deadliness of slingers in ancient warfare, but his assertion that Goliath is the warrior 'outgunned' by his opponent (""'Goliath had as much chance against David,' the historian Robert Dohrenwend writes, 'as any Bronze Age warrior with a sword would have had against an [opponent] armed with a .45 automatic.'"") doesn't seem so much a radical reassessment of the mythic conflict as a pedestrian reassertion of its traditional significance. And the claim that the 'historical' Goliath suffered, like Guiness's tallest-man-ever Robert Wadlow, from acromegaly, strikes me as the sort of disturbingly naive literalism I would expect from a televangelist and not a staff science writer for the New Yorker. Does he suppose that the giant in the Jack tales suffered from the malady, as well?But, I quibble. The concepts of relative deprivation and desirable difficulty were convincing if notentirely new, and the analysis of iconic civil rights photographs, particularly the image of teenage Walter Gadsden being 'attacked' by a police dog, was revelatory. Gladwell has a clean, unobtrusive style and a facility for translating arid scientific literature into engaging layman's prose.Can I offer you a Cheeto?","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.121,0.76,0.119,-0.1955,Negative,,
"I was not impressed. Although I have liked Gladwell's other books, this one was a miss. While I recognize that he finds empirical studies to support the central ideas of his books and am generally okay with that, he went too far with David and Goliath. It was clear that he had a conviction that he wanted to persuade others to adopt and the stories in the book were chosen for that purpose. That part was expected and understandable; the part I couldn't get past was that I have read many of the studies that he cited and disagree with the conclusions. Additionally, he gave a lot of stories to persuade a reader toward his opinion of class size reduction, but nearly all of the studies that supported his claims came from Economics journals. My final complaint is that the stories used to illustrate his central idea felt disjointed and haphazard. All in all, this was not a well-written book that worked toward a coherent conclusion.

"پیشنهاد به:اگر ازدیدن زوایای نهان پدیده ها که از دید غالب مردم نهان هست لذت می برد.اگر خطی فکر می کنید و از مواجه با غول های زندگی (رقیبان سرسخت، اتفاقات ناگوار زندگی) واهمه دارید.حتما این کتاب رو بخونیدموضوع کتاباین کتاب از حکایت نبرد داود (چوپان ظاهرا نحیف اسرائیلی) که جالوت (جنگ جوی غول پیکر فلسطینی) رو شکست می ده درس ها و نکته های بزرگی رو بیان می کنه و نگاه کاملا متفاوت و بهتری نسبت به چیزی که ما ضعف یا قدرت پیش خودمون می پنداریم ارائه می کنهبررسی و محتوایک دسته کتاب ها هستن که بعد از خوندنشون شخص انگار با دید شفاف تر و بهتری به دنیا نگاه می کنه و این کتاب قطعا یکی ازون هاست. حکایت نبرد داود و جالوت این درس رو می ده که چه طور چیزی که به ظاهر ضعف می پنداریم می تونه نقطه قوت و چیزی که قدرت می پنداریم می تونه پاشنه آشیلی بشه برای صاحب اون قدرت و اینکه شرایطی دهشتناک چه طور می تونه زمینه ساز پیداش و شکوفایی استعداد ها و نیروی های نهفته در فرد یا ملتی بشه.The act of facing overwhelming odds produces greatness and beauty and giants are not what we think they are. به طور کلی کتاب سعی در بخشیدن رویکرد و نگاه جدیدی به ما داره در مواجه با شرایطی که به طور غریضی در موردشن نتیجه گیری می کنیم. به سوالات زیر فکر کنید و ببینید چه جوابی به ذهنتون می رسه؟1. آیا کاهش تعداد دانش آموزان کلاس، به بالا رفتن بهره وری و کیفیت آموزش و یادگیری کمک می کنه؟2. آیا افزایش دادن مجازات جرم، باعث کاهش اون می شه؟3. نرخ خودکشی در یه کشور با سطح خوشحالی بالاتر بیشتر هست یا در کشوری که غالب جامعه افسرده هستن؟جواب سوالای بالا بسیار متفاوت با چیزی هست که به طور درونی فکر می کنیم درست هستن و این کتاب بالقوه خواننده رو به یک ماژول فکری جدید مجهز می کنه که به طور خطی به پدیدا نگاه نکنه. The powerful and strong, are not always what they seem.حالا به این سوال فکر کنید، پذیرش گرفتن از دانشگاهی مثل هاروارد بهتره یا قبولی در یک دانشگاه خوب در چند پله پایین تر مثل مریلند؟جواب پیش فرض و غریضی غالب مردم احتمالا این هست که خوب هاروارد تاپ ترین دانشگاه دنیاست و احتمالا این گزینه رو انتخاب می کنند در صورتی که شاید این انتخاب نقطه ای سرخط بر دنبال کردن تحصیلات دانشگاهی برای اون شخص بشه. We strive for the best and attach great importance to getting into the finest institutions we can. But rarely do we stop and consider whether the most prestigious of institutions is always in our best interest. در کتاب مفهومی که در این خصوص بررسی می شه ""محدودیت نسبی"" نام داره به این معنی که آدم ها از نظر توانایی و صلاحیت خودشون رو در مقیاس بزرگ و جهانی نمی سنجن بلکه به طور محلی و در مقایسه با افرادی که در تعامل با اون هستن بررسی می کنن که این موضوع مثل یک شمشیر دو لبه عمل می کنه. مثلا فرد باهوشی که در جمع نوابع قرار بگیره ممکنه احساس خنگ بودن بهش دست بده و همین سد راهی بشه برای دنبال کردن اهداف بزرگی که قبلا داشت و قابل دست رس می دید.Students who would feel that they have mastered a subject at a good school can have the feeling that they are falling farther and farther behind in a really good school. How you feel about your abilities—your academic “self-concept”—in the context of your classroom shapes your willingness to tackle challenges and finish difficult tasks. It’s a crucial element in your motivation and confidence.با این توضیح می تونید سوال سوم رو در بالا جواب بدید. در بخش دیگه ای، نویسنده به بررسی مواردی که ما به طور پیش فرض ضعف و نقصان می پنداریم می پردازه. سوال زیر رو در نظر بگیرید:به نظر شما داشتن بیماری دیسلکسیا ( بیماری که با داشتن، شخص توانایی یادگیری خواندن و نوشتن رو نخواهد داشت) خوب هست یا بد؟ باز هم عقل سلیم ممکنه بگه چه طور همچین بیماری می تونه خوب باشه. اما باز هم به خوبی مالکوم گلدول نگاه جدیدی رو به خواننده می ده که چه طور وجود یک محدودیت یا اشکال می تونه باعث شکل گیری توانایی ها و مهارت هایی بشه که فرد رو به شهرت جهانی برسونه.مطابق آخرین مطالعات دانشگاه لندن حدود یک سوم کارآفرینان موفق دچار این بیماری هستن. اشخاص بزرگی مثل ریچارد برنسون، جان چیمبرز، چارلز شواب و بسیاری اسامی دیگر...What is learned out of necessity is inevitably more powerful than the learning that comes easily.کلا همه کتاب های مالکوم گلدول این سبک رو دنبال می کنن و سعیش در آشکار کردن زاویه های پنهان پدیده های مختلف هست. شاید خیلی از بررسی ها و نتیجه گیری هاش درست نباشن، اما از این جهت که یک دید جدید برای نگاه کردن به وقایع به خواننده هاش می ده بسیار ارزشمند هستند.یکی دیگه از بخش های خوب کتاب بررسی مفهوم ""خطای دور"" هست و داستان جنگ جهانی و حمله هوایی آلمان ها به لندن رو بررسی می کنه و اینکه سران انگلیس چه هراس زیادی نسبت به عواقب روانی این حملات داشتن و در شگفتی تمام دیدن این حملات نه تنها موجب روانی و شوکه شدن غالب مردم نشد، بلکه باعث شجاعت هرچه بیشترشون شد و همونطور که یکی از فصل های کتاب ""جادوی اندیشه بزرگ"" هم هست، مواجه شدن با ترس اون رو از بین می بره:""We are all of us not merely liable to fear, we are also prone to be afraid of being afraid, and the conquering of fear produces exhilaration... The contrast between the previous apprehension of fear and the present relief and feeling of security promotes self-confidence that is the very father and mother of courage. Courage is not something that you already have that makes you brave when the tough times start. Courage is what you earn when you’ve been through the tough times and you discover they aren’t so tough after all.در بخش آخر هم کتاب مفاهیم قدرت و صلاحیت رو بررسی می کنه و به خوبی استدال می کنه که صرف داشتن قدرت علیه یک گروه یا ملت برای کنترل و داشتن فرمان برداریشون تا زمانی که اون قدرت همراه با صلاحیت نباشه به هیچ وجه کافی نیست و این خیال باطل صاحبان قدرت هست که در تکاپوی برقراری نظم دلخواهشون کار دستشون می ده:It has been said that most revolutions are not caused by revolutionaries in the first place, but by the stupidity and brutality of governments. جمع بندیشخصا چند معیار برای سنجیدن و وزن دادن به کتاب ها دارم، و یکی از اون ها این هست که بعد از خوندن کتاب، آیا نگاه من به دنیا تغییر می کنه یا نه. از این جهت کتاب بسیار بسیار برای من ارزشمند بود و قطعا خوندنش رو به همه پیشنهاد می کنم. لینک دریافت کتاب خدمت دوستان:https://goo.gl/sfsHjB","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.032,0.904,0.065,0.9888,Positive,,
"As with everything Gladwell, this book is a fun and fast read that is not at all careful with its conclusions. It's not careful scholarship, but Gladwell doesn't claim it to me. In other words, he tells a story with great anecdotes and some data that doesn't always support the point he is making. However, I believe the point he is making in David and Goliath (that underdogs can have hidden strengths and that trials and tragedy can lead to strong character). The point is valid and the stories are riveting. As with all of his books, I learned a lot about some key historical figures as well as some key historical events and came away with a different perspective on my own assumptions. It was also an inspiring read and the stories were really well-written. But of course, I think he over-reaches in many of his conclusions.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.069,0.796,0.135,0.9139,Positive,,
"Chicken Soup for the Pop Psychologist's Soul. Or something like that.The plural of anecdote is not data. And when Mr. Gladwell has a hammer, everything looks like a nail. That is, he is a very persuasive writer, but ultimately I'm not really convinced about all of his conclusions. Do I need to point out that as social science goes, this is heavy on the social and light on the science? You probably already knew that.Anyway, I did enjoy this one. Everyone loves an underdog. And I enjoyed his retelling of certain historical events and eras. It makes me want to go back and do my own research on some of those stories to see how much of the telling is Gladwell's and how much is actually history.I listened to this on audiobook, and Gladwell narrated. Excellent choice.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.021,0.804,0.174,0.9727,Positive,,
"*A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/10/22...This book is not about underdogs and giants in any conventional sense of these terms. Rather, the book is about the curious nature of advantages and disadvantages, and how each can (under certain circumstances) become its opposite.The first lesson to be learned is that the things we take to be advantages are often no such thing. Our greatest mistake here comes from the fact that we identify a certain quality or characteristic as being a benefit or advantage, and then assume that the more of it there is the better—when this is often not the case. Put another way, most of us recognize that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, and yet we fail to appreciate just how often and where this principle applies. For instance, we recognize that having a certain amount of money greatly facilitates raising children (it being very difficult to raise a family in a state of poverty), and yet we fail to recognize that beyond a certain point wealth also makes parenting increasingly difficult (for it becomes harder and harder to instill qualities of hard work and self-control). Or we recognize that small class sizes are a good thing, and yet we fail to recognize that classes can actually begin to suffer once they become too small (since diversity and energy begin to disappear).Another arena wherein an advantage can become a disadvantage is in power and authority. Power and authority is an advantage, of course; however, when it is wielded illegitimately and without fairness, it can actually cause more chaos, destruction and violence than it curbs. This is as true in the classroom as it is in community policing as it is in handling minority groups within a nation’s borders.The second lesson to be learned here is that certain disadvantages can sometimes drive people into positions of advantage. Take the disadvantage of being born with a disability, for example. Say dyslexia. In our modern world, where the ability to read is extremely important—and practically a requirement for success—having great difficulty with reading is a major disadvantage. And indeed the statistics indicate that the vast majority of those who are born dyslexic end up falling through the cracks and missing out on success.Still, though, many dyslexics have gone on to become highly successful people; and it has also been noted that in certain fields (such as entrepreneurship) an inordinate proportion of the most successful individuals do, in fact, have dyslexia. So how can we explain these success stories? What we find in these cases is that these individuals have managed to compensate for their disability by developing skills that make up for their flaws (such as an improved memory or debating prowess). Thus, in a way, the successful dyslexic has actually benefited from his disability, because it has forced him into a position where he has had to develop other skills that have led him directly to success.Also at play here is the fact that dyslexics tend to endure many failures when they are young. Repeated failures (especially at a young age) have the potential to crush the spirit. But they can also have the opposite effect: they can inure the individual to failure, thus making them more likely to take risks and try things that others wouldn’t—which is often a sure path to success.A similar phenomenon also sometimes touches trauma victims. Take the ultimate trauma of losing a parent in childhood, for example. This is one of the worse experiences imaginable, and the trauma of losing a parent in childhood does indeed crush the vast majority of those who have the misfortune of enduring it.Again, though, it has been noted that a very high proportion of highly successful individuals across many fields (from science to art to politics) have in fact lost a parent in childhood. And what we find in these cases is that the experience has left these individuals with the mind-set that now that they have endured such a terrible event, that nothing could ever be so bad. And thus they are liberated from the fear of failure, and—like the successful dyslexic—are willing to try things and take risks that others are not (which often leads directly to success).The same experience and logic can also apply to underdog groups. For example, when a group recognizes that it is severely over-matched in terms of skill or strength compared to its opponent, it can begin to feel liberated to try unconventional tactics and approaches. This is often for the best, for it turns out that unconventional tactics and approaches are frequently very effective against giants—in everything from sports, to politics to war—and are, in many cases, the only chance the underdog has to win anyway. Again, then, in both of these instances (the trauma victim and the underdog group) a disadvantage has driven the party into a position of advantage, and thus the disadvantage may itself be seen as a kind of boon.Gladwell has done well to make us rethink the nature of advantages and disadvantages across many fields. The only major flaw in the book, in my view, is the third and final part. The theme of the part is that power becomes less effective (or even counter-productive) when it is wielded illegitimately. The problem with this argument is that it's a classic case of the straw-man: Gladwell has set up an opposition that is very easy to defeat, and then smashed it to pieces. What's worse is that the examples Gladwell uses to prove his point here are quite weak. Still, there is much of value in the first 2 parts of the book.

"This is the kind of book I would normally dismiss immediately, but as a book club pick I gave it a shot. I started with a sample on my kindle, but after falling asleep several times reading that I transitioned to audio-book so I could listen while driving. At about 3 chapters in, I wanted to quit. Both the content and the style of writing were the opposite of interesting to me. Obviously the author is trying to make a point and I understood that all of the anecdotal comparisons should be leading me towards a conclusion of some kind. But either I'm too dense, or it's too obvious. Because I have no idea what this book is about. Story after story circles back making loose comparisons without much progression. Bibles and basketball to class size and Impressionism. And on my side, a nap while trying to give it a listen on a Saturday afternoon. After waking up... fish and ponds, and then dyslexia and so called ""desirable difficulties"". Whoa. Note that some of the stories are interesting in themselves, but I think that the connections Gladwell is trying to make to prove his point are tenuous at best. They could also just be coincidences. Yes some people are successful despite overcoming difficulties, but many are not. When he does make a point it seems almost a ""gotcha"" moment as you're wrapping up one story and he suddenly circles you back to something covered a chapter ago and tries to make a connection... Maybe these times were an AHA moment for some, but I continued to be unimpressed. Over halfway through was giving this a fair shake, I think, and turned my attentions to more interesting activities. But then I just had to finish. I knew if I really wanted to write this review it had to be with a full knowledge of what the book entailed. Apparently these books are popular because they translate the social sciences to the masses. And while I do think social sciences are interesting, results of these types of studies can be easily manipulated to make a point. The Wall Street Journal's review sums it up nicely, ""Malcolm Gladwell too often presents as proven laws what are just intriguing possibilities and musings about human behavior.""The notion that a rule holds true except for when it doesn't runs through David and Goliath.You can't make 300 pages out of interesting possibilities and musings. At least not one I want to read. It seems to me that while there might be some bits to learn here, the whole thing is strung together with such tenuous threads it's hard to take any of it seriously.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,1.0,0.045,0.825,0.13,0.9927,Positive,,
"Malcolm Gladwell Surprises AgainEver since I read Malcolm Gladwell’s breakthrough book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, I’ve been unable to resist any new book from this most devilishly clever of nonfiction writers. Gladwell’s mind doesn’t seem to work the way mine does, and, unless you’re remarkably eccentric, I suspect the same could be said of you.David and Goliath is an excellent case in point. You might assume, as I so naturally did, that the Biblical tale of David and Goliath illustrates how the weak can overcome the strong. Certainly, that was how I was taught it as a child, and nothing I’ve learned since has led me to think otherwise. Leave it to Malcolm Gladwell to demonstrate that in reality this oft-told story demonstrates precisely the opposite. According to Gladwell (and to the numerous academic researchers whose work he cites), Goliath was massively vulnerable — in large part precisely because he was truly a giant — and David possessed an enormous advantage in his own right from the moment he walked onto the field of battle. The outcome of the battle was foreordained. Goliath’s great strength was in fact no advantage at all.In this out-of-left-field manner, Gladwell draws diverse examples from all over the map to illustrate his principal points: overwhelming power can easily prove to be a disadvantage, while disability and weakness can lead to surprising success. Gladwell writes about how dyslexia has proven to be the hidden key to success among a great many highly successful people, including such notables as Richard Branson and Charles Schwab. Other examples in David and Goliath include the coach of an untalented middle-school girls’ basketball team who led them to a national championship by virtue of a strategy born of his ignorance of basketball, to K-12 teachers who demonstrate how small classes can be disadvantageous and big classes sometimes much better, to the British troops sent to quell the Irish Troubles, only to discover that their exercise of power backfired horribly.David and Goliath is endlessly fascinating. It’s fully worthy of Malcolm Gladwell’s outstanding talent to illuminate our world in surprising ways.","David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.08,0.743,0.178,0.9914,Positive,,
"To play by David’s rules you have to be desperate. You have to be so bad that you have no choice.Miracle at Brighton brought me to this book, (Japan vs South Africa 2015 rugby world cup) feeling bad for Eddie Jones, well must laugh now at my traumatic expierience few years ago with junior rugby coaching was like herding stray cats and talking to parents an art in itself I was either rubbish or mediocre, mostly aimed for the short and sweet, dont get me wrong it was fun and my son and I can joke about it now and we do remind ourselves and it created good memories. Anyway back to this book it was great insightful and fun. Malcolm tells information in a simple to follow manner but the point is understood if I'm confused it clears quickly frankly in awe what the far. No matter how daunting your problem appears there is an advantage and as the underdog this keeps you in the fight. But sometimes you got to call it a spade, accept defeat lick your wounds and return another day bright eyed and bushy tailed. This Dad in one story a software engineer from India (cricket dominated) recently moving to the U.S with no idea how to play basketball but because of love went to coach his 12 year old daughters basketball team, he watched a few games and thought that's not how you should play, through careful look at the rules, training to be the fittest team out, a team which had never won a game he then takes this unlikely group to state finals and becomes a legend. Malcolm talks of real world David and Goliath situations throughout the book, how these can help on some sort of personal level is beyond my intellect but there you go. There is the freshman who went to Brown University and struggled, to pass her exams. A young catholic mother trying to live a humble life in 1970s troubled northern Ireland in a protestant dominated neighborhood.

"Gladwell Dropped the RockI read this upon its publication a few years ago. I was disappointed because it was a real drop-off from Gladwell's previous books, such as Outliers: The Story of Success and, to a lesser degree, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference. A few of his anecdotes, for example those relating to schooling, seemed a real stretch to support the book's theme of David v. Goliath. At times, it felt like he'd found some unrelated stories and tried to cobble them into a proof of his hypothesis.I still appreciate Gladwell's work and his contribution to American letters.

"I stayed up reading this book until I finished it, not only because I'm currently five books behind schedule and I just had two very big cups of tea, but also because this book, like most of Gladwell's other books, is very readable and engaging. Well at least it was to me! I am of course, aware of the criticism this book has received, and I agree that his arguments should be taken... well, not very seriously. But even so, I still believe much of his arguments will hold, at least partially. Gladwell sees things differently, and that is also one of the reasons why I enjoy reading his books! He has this thing were he can put a bunch of stuff together and come up with brilliant conclusions. I love that! I struggled whether I should give this one five stars or four. It actually does matter to me! Stars aren't for free now are they?! I'm going to give this one four stars anyways.

"An intriguing and fascinating read which lets readers to travel through colourful case studies about characters ranging from misfits to underdogs who had overturned their difficulties and challenges in their respective social environments and naturalattributes i.e. difficult childhood, dyslexia, racial segregations etc. More importantly, Gladwell examines WHY underdogs succeed when odds are totally against them. A wonderful counterintuitive exploration combining Gladwell's crafty, intoxicating storytelling with fascinating facts regarding cancer treatment, Battle of Britain, civil right movements and admission into elite institutions. This book also serves an inspiring read for those who are struggling through bad times and inturn, teaches us to harness our disadvantages and compensate/consolidate it with our other strengths.

"This book is fascinating and I was disappointed to read that many other readers didn't think so. So here's my response. I think those readers are approaching this book the wrong the way when they critisize Gladwell for his inability to prove his points thoroughly. Sure, Gladwell could have dotted every i and crossed every t and shown every counter-example to the theories he's proposing. There's a word for the books that accomplish that: BORING. Gladwell is a storyteller and he knows how to keep the reader involved. By going into too much detail, he would lose his audience. Hopefully the reader who isn't convinced entirely can go into further detail by reading Gladwell's sources which are exhaustively referenced in the back of the book. Another criticism is that Gladwell doesn't come to a specific point or that his points are hazy (this was probably more true with ""Blink""). I almost want to say ""who cares?"" This book and ""Blink"" are veritable digests of the latest advances in psychology and sociology. So what if the overarching idea of the book is loose? You have now understood countless fascinating anecdotes which you can reconstruct in your own way. It is Gladwell's loose structure that allows him to connect these disparate dots in a story that you can digest, and despite the accusations that he is not precise about his overall thesis, the individual incidents are very well explained. I love knowing the differences between Sesame Street and Blue's Clues and the differences between an adult's and a child's cognitive capabilities. Would I have read an entire book devoted solely to that? Probably not, but I was happy to read a chapter devoted to it, and a very well-written one at that.Perhaps I approach non-fiction in a different way than most--and I will admit that I'm fascinated by almost any new, dramatically different idea about any subject, regardless of whether or not I believe it to be true--but I think that people who go into this book seeking a different way of thinking about the world around us, macro & microcosmically, will enjoy themselves. Those who go into the book seeking to be convinced beyond doubt that that way of thinking is the correct way, will not.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.072,0.836,0.092,0.8134,Positive,,
"This book grew out of an article Malcolm Gladwell was writing for the New Yorker. Frankly, it is better suited for a 5-7 page article rather than a 280 page book. The crux of the book is that the ""stickiness factor"" of epidemics (whatever the nature) begins with a tipping point. This tipping point arises because of three distinct sets of individuals: mavens, connectors and salespeople. He also examines the well-known S-curve which begins with innovators, then early adopters, followed by the early majority and finally, the late majority. He is overwhelmingly redundant in expressing his ideas, providing examples of epidemics throughout the text while comparing them to one another (children's television, Hushpuppy shoes, Paul Revere's ride, nicotine, and the list goes on and on...). The Conclusion, the eighth and final chapter, was pointless: if the reader did not understand Gladwell's point by now, he or she must have been as lost as Washington Redskins' new coach Jim Zorn when he commented his family was proud to wear maroon and black.All that said, the book was not horrible. It was a well written first person narrative and the lessons of the emergence of epidemics are applicable to almost any career or lifestyle, as Gladwell demonstrated with his countless examples.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,2.0,0.018,0.931,0.051,0.7992,Positive,,
"Can I give this zero stars?When I read this book, back in 2006, I got really mad and wrote a scathing review of it on Amazon.com. Here it is:""I've been duped!, June 20, 2006By Sarah (California, USA) - See all my reviewsThis book sucks. Don't waste your hard earned money on it. Let me save you a few bucks here: Malcolm Gladwell is either a self-aggrandizing ass who is too busy thinking he is the god of marketing to notice that a great majority of his arguments lack any kind of cohesion or credibility whatsoever, or he is just so excited about his self-proclaimed 'paradigmatic' keys to the essense of social epidemics that he conveniently forgets to include that much needed credible evidence to support his long-winded theories, resulting in a book fit to satiate the appetite of audiences hungry for pop pseudo-science BS that will make them feel smart for reading it. Basically all this book is is a compilation of anecdotal evidence that is supposed to prove the truth in his words. Gladwell's arguments clearly violate some very important rules guiding intelligent thought: correlation does not imply causation (and the fact that two events happened on one occasion at the same time does not necessarily imply correlation), and the idea that a theory is bankable because one instance of anecdotal evidence exists. Umm, okay, that's like saying that I know a guy who won the lottery (I don't, but humor me), so it must be a logically good place to invest my paychecks (I don't have paychecks, but, please, humor me). I mean, I'm a 21-year-old college student, and not even a GOOD college student at that, and I could easily point out the flaws in his arguments -not just a single argument, but ALL of his arguments -as soon as I read them. I didn't even have to put the book down to think for a few minutes before I realized how absolutely pointless and downright ludicrous his 'insights' were. All that aside, his writing style is so patronizing and self-congratulatory that I could hardly stand to read any more than five pages at a time before my face got all scrunched up and I started uncontrollably muttering curse words under my breath. It makes me sad that people read this book and consider it a revelation in modern psychological and scientific thinking, not seeing it for what it is: an apparently very successful (thanks, readers of America) profit-driven waste of time. Gladwell made a ton of money off what probably only took him, like, 15 minutes to write, and THAT is the only thing genius about this book.""Yeah, I was kinda mad when I wrote that. This book doesn't really do much in the way of illustrating how to market ideas -rather, it seems more like a marketing tool itself.

I read The Tipping Point as an ebook, so my pages might not match completely with yours, but it's the story about the AIDS virus, Chapter One, Section 2, page 24. In writing about a weird epidemic among newborns in the 1950s, Gladwell says of the lead scientist, ""Goudsmit thinks that this was an early HIV epidemic.""Nothing wrong with that. Gladwell is reporting what a scientist thinks. Gladwell then offers an extended quote from Dr. Goudsmit, which is loaded with conditional statements: ""this adult could have died of AIDS"", ""he could have transmitted the virus"", ""she could have given birth to an HIV infected child"", ""unsterilized needles could have spread the virus"". Again, all well and good: Goudsmit was speculating, and making it clear that what he was saying was not certain, but that it ""could have"" happened.Then Gladwell returns and destroys the careful foundation he had built by making concrete statements about things that a moment before were only hypotheses: ""They defeated HIV"", ""The strains of HIV circulating in the 1950s were a lot different from the HIV circulating today"", ""HIV itself changed"" None of this is proven by any of the information Gladwell gave us. All of it is speculation. But Gladwell draws firm conclusions from things that are, at best, educated guesses. I'm sorry but that's just wrong. Actually, I'm not sorry. What Gladwell did is so wrong it's unforgivable.I've been a journalist for 20 years, and I work with some of the finest fact checkers in the world. If I ever handed in a badly reasoned piece of shit like this book, they'd tear me a new asshole. (No they wouldn't. They're very nice people. But they would tear the manuscript a new asshole, as they should.) More to the point, I have enough respect for myself, my readers, and my fact checkers that I'd never hand in something like this in the first place. That Gladwell thought he could get away with it (and let's face it, he did get away with it) is metaphorically criminal. Fuck him.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,1.0,0.148,0.776,0.076,-0.9895,Negative,,
"Really good book. It read like a bestseller (quick read), but had a lot of substance to stop and make you think.three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few, the stickyness factor, the power of context.Law of the Few (people who influence): - Connectors: super connectors (eg Paul Revere). William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we haven't heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a super-connector & knew who to rouse. - Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into ""conversational harmony"" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan.Stickyness Factor - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn't hold attention until each show was good. - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. - make the message personal to make it memorable The Power of Context - Broken window theory. NYC cleaned up its crime epidemic by cleaning off the graffiti from its subways.  - Often to change human behavior you have to change the context the problem is presented in. - Stanford Prison Experiment by Zimbardo proved that context matters. - law of 150: a person can't 'know' more than 150 people, so companies usually start to fail at that point. Gore-Tex breaks up a company into 2 once it hits 150, because they've found things work better that way.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.071,0.752,0.176,0.9905,Positive,,
"I think missed the best by date for this book. It's more fun than an introductory course in sociology and covers some of the same material. Reminded me of Bellwether by Connie Willis and William Gibson's Blue Ant series. All looking for the point where people change behavior and a new trend begins.I loved the part about creating the children's education tv programs Sesame Street and Blue's Clues. What worked with preschoolers, and what didn't.It seems likely Gladwell relies on his enthusiasm for his theory more than fact. That being said, I'll probably read more of his books.

"Here’s why you need to read The Tipping Point. You don’t!!Look, it’s not because the writing is poor, the concepts disorganized, or the book fails to instruct. It’s simply that the ideas are anachronistic. This is no fault of Malcolm Gladwell. He published in 2000, wrote in ‘99, and used case studies from the mid-90’s. How could he have known he was publishing a book about social media on the eve of social media’s inchoate move into our social DeoxyriboNucleicAcid, or that the overgrowth of social connectedness would evolve at rates understated by the term logarithmic.This is a snappy little book--a good one for Thursday evening book club affairs. I quite liked it. Digestible chapters with jaunty titles, connecting for the reader complex sociocultural beliefs to gravid marketing slogans. Pert discussion, and a context that builds on previous conclusions, leading the audience like an unbridled horse gently to water. Gladwell, he’s a good salesman, one that can close a deal without hiding a rotten premolar or repeatedly glancing at his wristwatch. It’s 3.5 stars.Nevertheless, if you’ve fogged a mirror in the last 10 years, much of what Gladwell worked hard to synthesize in year 2000 is merely a matter of course in the mercurial, social, connected life we lead today. Essentially the book is about marketing. (There’s more herein than marketing, but that’s what I’d like to focus on). The title underscores a link throughout the book, viz., that no matter the medium, information reaches a ‘tipping’ point beyond which it spreads above and away from any reasonable measure of altitude control. He repeatedly uses the term epidemic, and I like the image that word conjures in my mind when I think of how pervasive and persistent and contagious marketing can be (like the scene in Ten Commandments where the pestilence of God’s wrath moves down from the moon and like a swampy yellow miasma flows through the streets of Ramses’s Egypt) . Gladwell lays down some meaty discussion about the ‘whys’ and ‘wherefore's’ of the nature of networked relationships, using sociology, psychology, penal philosophy, genetics, pop culture, economics, archeobiology, and personal interviews. It’s a snapshot of a fossil, though. He is in essence describing our world when information was still Near Real Time (NRT), a military acronym meaning ‘actionable’ but not ‘exactable.’ We upgraded that acronym circa 2004-2006 when information became--no shit--Real Time. Real Time worldwide data is a phenomena we’ve only recently begun to comprehend and manipulate. Write a discussion about how your start-up can triangulate consumers, and you’ll have a lead story in Harvard Business Review. Develop an android app that geolocates high volume consumers, and Starbucks will give $$credit$$ to the first 10 people that check into their stores in Cleveland, Charlotte, and Chattanooga. Twitter trends topics, not daily, but hourly. Google Metrics displays global boolean traffic on word searches RIGHT NOW. Crowdsourcing, flash mobs, #hashtags. I can set a Google alert that pings me the next time Brittany Spears has an inadvertent bush shot at the Palms Casino. I can scan barcodes on my phone, and know by a factor of pennies where I can get the cheapest sun dried tomatoes. I can listen to any law enforcement scanner in the country while sitting in my tighty-whities in my fall-out basement. Gowalla, Foursquare, StumbleUpon, grooveshark, HTML5, mashable, MMORPGs, skype, Goodreads. And the every present memes--viral video memes, photo memes--Christ, look at the major news networks during an election and watch the TV anchors in the studio move to the floating, diaphanous plates of glass and enlarge voting counties and predict elections with two-fingered zoom.Malcolm Gladwell could not have foreseen the breadth and rapidity of tipping points in today’s market. No one could have--not even industry leaders in year 2000. Tipping points are not isolated events anymore, like the slow resurgence of Hush Puppy shoes from 1994-1996 (the most cited tipping point in the book, and one Gladwell considers--by his own criteria--rapid). They are daily memes, forcing us into ever tighter circles of consumption, and causing many of us to brux our teeth when we lose cell coverage or go to airplane mode on our smart phones. SMART PHONES--a technology by itself that puts the rust on Gladwell’s conception of tipping points. Despite sound research methodology, and pertinent statistical evaluation, I don’t envision many people going back to The Tipping Point. It’s like reading last week’s headlines; last year’s Consumer Reports; financial data from 2008; political promises from 2006; real estate values from 2005, or the Manhattan skyline on 10 Sep 2001. Maybe for an anecdotal dissertation by some students squirreled away at Weber State or Lehigh University, but other than that I think most of the 77,000 Goodread reviews of this book occurred much nearer the time it was on the best seller list in 2000-2001. There are 4 copies available at my library. It ain’t flying off the shelves anymore, and neither is the 1994 Rand McNally Atlas. You dig?But, wait, let’s go deeper. I dogeared these passages.Here are the titles of the 4 parts of this book. I.EpidemicsII. The Law of the Few: Connectors, Mavens, and SalesmenIII. The Stickiness FactorIV. The Power of Context-- These are important constituents in marketing, but Gladwell speaks of months and years. We both know it's days and hours in 2011.What was the connection between the East Village and Middle America? The Law of the Few says the answer is that one of these exceptional people found out about the trend, and through social connections and energy and enthusiasm and personality spread the word about Hush Puppies. (p. 22)-- Social connectedness was an ephemeral measurement in 1999. Now organizations have followers (see Facebook and Twitter) and can measure their daily virility (see the ‘like’ button and most-viewed videos on Youtube) and watch their epidemic spread (see trending topics on technorati or mashable or gizmodo).It is safe to say that word of mouth is--even in this age of mass communications and multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns--still the most important form of human communication. Think, for a moment, about the last expensive restaurant you went to, the last expensive piece of clothing you bought, and the last movie you saw. In how many of those cases was your decision about where to spend your money heavily influenced by the recommendation of a friend...word-of-mouth appeals have become the only kind of persuasion that most of us respond to anymore. (p. 32)-- Yes, word of mouth is, indeed, persuasive. But, today we are motivated and persuaded even more by word of text!!!Your friends...occupy the same world that you do. They might work with you, or live near you, and go to the same churches, schools, or parties. How much, then, would they know that you wouldn’t know? Your acquaintances, on the other hand, by definition occupy a very different world than you. They are much more likely to know something that you don’t... Acquaintances, in short, represent a source of social power, and the more acquaintances you have the more powerful you are. (p. 54)-- This is perhaps Gladwell’s most prophetic statement. I know more people today having never met face to face than actual people I knew in 1999.Mavens have the knowledge and the social skills to start word-of-mouth epidemics. What sets Mavens apart, though, is not so much what they know but how they pass it along. The fact that Mavens want to help, for no other reason than because they like to help, turns out to be an awfully effective way of getting someone’s attention. (p. 67)-- Today Lady Gaga, Kanye West, and Ben Affleck, combined, have more ‘followers’ than the population of Panama.We have become, in our society, overwhelmed by people clamoring for our attention. In just the past decade, the time devoted to advertisements in a typical hour of network television has grown from 6 minutes to 9 minutes, and it continues to climb every year...estimates that the average American is now exposed to 254 different commercial messages in a day, up nearly 25% since the mid-1970s. There are now millions of web sites on the Internet, cable systems routinely carry over 50 channels of programming, and a glance inside the magazine section of any bookstore will tell you that there are thousands of magazines coming out each month... (p. 98)-- Multiply all of the above figures by a factor of 10 to the 2nd power. A rate of growth that cannot be compared by measuring from 1999 back to the existence of Abraham.The spread of any new and contagious ideology has a lot to do with the skillful use of group power.

"""But a small change is often all that it takes.""There are many schools of thought when it comes to interpreting the reasons behind why somethings 'stick', while others just exist in background.

With the slightest push - in just the right place - it can be tipped.""This is a relatively short book - compared to some other books on same subject - and attempts to explain the author's three principles with the help of some well known 'social epidemics'.

"I wish there was another word I could use instead of sexy. I mean it metaphorically, obviously, but I want to tell you about the thing that I find to be the most sexy thing imaginable – and I’ve realised that sexy isn’t really the word I should be using at all. You realise, of course, I’m talking about intellectually stimulating or satisfying when I say sexy. That is what I want to talk about – the thing that gives me my biggest intellectual buzz.Look, it isn’t any of the obvious things you might be thinking of – and all of those obvious things this book has in abundance. Not that I actually read this book – I listened to it as an audio book, and that is important to say because I don’t know if the book always has the afterword – and it is something in the afterword that I loved most about this otherwise merely wonderful book. (As you may have guessed, we will be returning to this later)What I’m saying is that Gladwell is a sexy kind of guy anyway, even before he did the best of all possible things in the afterword of this book. He is what I like to call an interpreter. I think he even refers to himself as this somewhere. He straddles a number of worlds – psychology, medicine, marketing, social theory, economics – and he draws lines between those worlds in the way one might if one was to place a piece of plastic film over another piece of plastic film on an overhead projector, so that what is written on both films of plastic merge to ‘complete the picture’ in beautifully interesting ways. Now, that is sexy – but it is only level one sexy. I love watching relationships and patterns appear and I love a good story and Gladwell knows his stuff when it comes to patterns and he really knows how to tell a good story. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing the matter with level one sexy – but it is intellectual foreplay and needs something more to be truly satisfying.One of the things this book is about is trends. How do trends start? What makes it fashionable for kids to start smoking? Why do books by unknown authors suddenly become best sellers? How is it that two people can do much the same thing (and he gives a fascinating example from American History to explain this) and yet have completely different (in fact, nearly opposite) results?Or why did Hush Puppies, a brand of shoes that had virtually died, suddenly become – in the lingo of the streets – uber-cool? (Yes, I know, ‘don’t try being cool, McCandless, it really doesn’t suit’.)Essentially, he talks about a small number of personality types that exist in the world that kick trends along, and these types of people help make ‘the virus of the latest thing’ spread to us all. Those types of people are, communicators (people who know essentially everyone), mavens (people who know essentially everything) and salesmen. Sometimes we think that if we want to spread an idea far and wide we should find a way to get it to as many people as possible – much like spam. But when was the last time you bought something recommended to you from a piece of spam you received in your inbox? See what I mean. But I guess most of us know some car nut we go to when we are thinking of buying a car, someone who reads all the car magazines and (maybe) even spends his (it is always a boy) weekends ‘test driving’ the latest models. This is the sort of person who can not only tell you the difference between an overhead cam-shaft and polyunsaturated margarine, but also why the cam-shaft is better than butter. (In case you have not quite worked it out yet, I am not one of those mavens)In a world awash with ‘information’ – much of which is lies (although it is probably best we call it by its more polite name, advertising) – we are becoming, ironically enough, more dependent on word of mouth information from sources we know we can trust. Now, isn’t that a wonderful thesis and a direct confirmation of what you probably already suspected, but hadn’t put into words yet. I guess this might be the second level of intellectual sexy.The next level towards intellectual nirvana is when someone says something totally unexpected that makes my brains resonate in a way that I know will have me thinking for weeks. And he did that this morning as I was walking back from the beach by talking about collective memory. This is penultimate in the scale of intellectual sexy – I knew when he said this that what he was saying was going to end up in my review.They did a test on people, they put people through a series of remembering tasks – and they gave them these tests in pairs. Some of the pairs were people who didn’t know each other from a bar of soap – and the others were people who were literally couples, people in relationships. And the result? Well, the people in the relationships did lots and lots better at remembering stuff than the people that the fickle hand of fate flung together. Isn’t that fascinating? Doesn’t that send a shiver down your spine? But it gets better. He then goes on to talk about why this might be the case – and essentially he claims that we use our partners as a memory extension slot for our own brains. In a relationship there is a division of labour when it comes to remembering stuff – with one partner remembering the kids’ birthdays and the other remembering how to use the ice cream maker.And now comes the bucket of ice water that made me stop on my walk and think, “God, now, isn’t that really, really interesting”. Part of the reason people fall into a deep depression when they go through a divorce (and I thought, perhaps even die shortly after their ‘life partner’dies) may not just be that their partner has metaphorically taken away a part of their heart, but literally taken away a part of their brain. It is that line from Laurie Anderson about when her father died how she felt like a library had burnt down (I think from The Ugly One with Jewels, just before Speak My Language, but I could be wrong).But do you know what is the sexiest thing about this book? And the reason why you should avoid a first edition and get an edition with the afterword? It is that after he has built a pretty good case for something, made a rather good comparison that he uses to sustain the last bit of the book, after he has finished writing the book, after it is printed and ‘done and dusted’, he thinks about it some more and makes a couple of major revisions to some of his thinking in the afterword that goes in a later edition. It is utterly clear to me that if he had the chance to write this book again he would do it differently. Essentially, the afterword is showing us how he would have made it different. He is showing that no idea is ever finished with, no idea can be finally put aside as a shining trophy, only to gather dust and bird shit, but ideas are only worthy of that name if they are alive and alive things change and grow or sometimes they sicken and die.And someone who does that, that goes away and thinks about it even after it is done and finished with and then comes back and says, “Actually, I could have done that a bit better, let me see if I can just say it this way…” Now, that is sexy – that is the best. This book is not nearly as good as Outliers, and I only read this book because I read that book. But do you know what? This book is good enough that if I’d read this book first I would have gone on read that book too.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.041,0.792,0.167,0.9996,Positive,,
"The biography of a very simple ideaThe back cover marketing blurb describes it very simply. “THE TIPPING POINT is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire.” The introduction covers that summary in slightly greater detail, “It is the best way to understand the emergence of fashion trends, the ebb and flow of crime waves, or, for that matter, the transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth, … Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do.”Teachers, advertising executives, business owners, politicians, social workers, authors and the like would do very well to read Malcolm Gladwell’s brilliant musings concerning the characteristics of “epidemic” style societal change – contagiousness; little causes can have enormous effects; and change happens, not gradually, but a single dramatic moments. I’m not sure that I learned anything that would affect my personal life or cause me to change my behaviour in any way but there is no question that I did learn stuff and I also enjoyed the ride.Indeed, there is every likelihood that if I had read THE TIPPING POINT as a young man, I would almost certainly have added Psychology as an elective to my university course list. It’s compelling, convincing and astonishingly interesting. BLINK, another of Malcolm Gladwell’s work, was just as amazing and I’ll look forward eagerly to trying more. OUTLIERS and TALKING TO STRANGERS come to mind as top of the list candidates.(On a related note, I'm wondering, given the world's current overwhelming concern with Coronavirus pandemic, if any public health officials have given thought to applying Gladwell's ideas to the intractable problem of persuading blockheaded American anti-vaxxers to change their minds??)Paul Weiss",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.035,0.832,0.133,0.9804,Positive,,
"The book that became a catchphrase! The term ""tipping point"" has become so commonly used in news stories that I wonder how many people know it came from a book.I read this back in 2000 when I was in grad school for sociology. It's a fun little book of case studies, many of which applied to what I was learning in my classes. Here it is 13 years later and I can still recall many of the details and theories, which shows how interesting I thought they were. Gladwell, who writes for The New Yorker, has a skill of weaving different elements and stories together into an enjoyable narrative. The gist of the book is how information spreads among people -- why do some ideas/products spread quickly and effectively, but others don't? Are there kinds of people who are better at transmitting information? (Hint: Yes, there are.)Some of the stories I remember best are about how ""Sesame Street"" was founded and its impact on literacy (it's surprisingly high!); how to reduce the spread of HIV among drug addicts; how the size of an office can enhance the feeling of community among its workers; how suicide can become more widespread in a region if someone of high stature commits it; and how crime can rise and fall in a city.But perhaps the most salient concept I still use is about connectors vs. mavens. A connector is someone who knows lots and lots of people. They are extroverts and are good at making casual acquaintances wherever they go. In contrast, a maven is a Yiddish term that means one who accumulates knowledge. These are people who gain the respect of friends and colleagues for giving good advice, so when they recommend something, the advice is usually followed. (For example, as a librarian I try to be a maven of good books.) Advertisers are interested in mavens because their opinions carry weight. Gladwell gives several examples of the differences between connectors and mavens, the main one being that the advice of a connector is not always taken even though he/she may give it to more people (because they know more people), but almost everyone follows the advice of a maven, even though they may give it to fewer people. So a maven might have more of an impact on spreading an idea.It would be interesting to reread this book now to see how it holds up, because many of these ideas seem to have become part of the cultural zeitgeist. I think I would still recommend it to anyone interested in some pop sociology.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.023,0.81,0.167,0.9964,Positive,,

"In a work heavily influenced by the budding science of memetics (though he never once uses the word meme), Malcom Gladwell seeks to provide a framework for explaining why certain isolated phenomena (suicide in Micronesia, wearing hush puppies, reading a particular novel) can suddenly become widespread and why situations can suddenly swing from one extreme (rampant crime in 80s NYC) to another (the huge drop in crime in that same city during the 90s). Gladwell postulates three mechanisms of cultural epidemiology, the axioms of the law of the few, the stickiness factor and the power of context. The law of the few declares that change is often initiated by a small group of people (three different types) with an ever-widening pyramid of influence. Making up the first type are the connectors, basically human nexuses whose webs of important acquaintances (note that these are not friends) spread out in logarithmic vertigos of extension (e.g., Revere’s “the British are coming” spread more quickly than that of William Dawes because of the many people Revere knew in the towns he visited). Another group mentioned in the law of the few are mavens, whom we could term data strategists, their almost hobby-like information-gathering not just carried out to further their own interests, but to assist a broader sphere of people. The final set of individuals counted among the few are the salesmen, persuasive communicators whose instinctual ability to adapt the non-verbal cues of others and infect them with emotion is key to effecting wide-sweeping change. The second axiom in Gladwell’s informal theory is stickiness: the impact of the vector on the host, i.e., an idea or product must be memorable in order to spread; otherwise, it will not be embraced by the people in the connector's network. As a result, marketers must constantly devise ways to present products so that they are memorable. Of course, there is no ready-made science of what makes something catchy. However, the effectiveness of a product or idea’s packaging can be tested and tweaked, as Gladwell demonstrates in his discussion of how the creators of Sesame Street and Blue’s Clues try to ensure that children remember their message (in other words, learn the concept being taught). The final factor leading toward the tipping point is the power of context. This area is less well defined by Gladwell, and he unfortunately seems to be trying to herd together a host of disparate considerations under a single, handy rubric. The basic concept is that human behavior is strongly influenced by external variables of context. For example, ""zero tolerance"" efforts to combat minor crimes such as fare-beating and vandalism on the New York subway led to a decline in more violent crimes; the perception of increased vigilance altered the behavior and attitudes of the passengers. This theory of broken windows is well-known in sociology: attention to small details, reparation of seemingly unimportant (when looking at the big picture) problems, can engender massive change in a larger system (this is sort of the butterfly effect of sociology). On the whole, however, Gladwell has made an admirable foray into the construction of a theoretical model of memetic transmission and epidemiology. Building upon his layman’s approach, scientists specializing in cultural transmission might now begin testing his specific claims with an eye toward developing such a model.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.057,0.895,0.048,-0.8166,Negative,,
"Holy suppositions, Gladwell! There's a whole lotta coulds, may haves, apparentlies, perhapses up in here!Malcolm Gladwell's basic premise in The Tipping Point: To explain how word-of-mouth is spread.A couple of the examples he used were how crime was reduced in NYC under Giuliani's reign and how an old, dead-in-the-water brand of shoes seemingly suddenly were selling like hotcakes. But honestly, my favorite bit was the section on Sesame Street.It's interesting stuff, no doubt with some truth to it, hell maybe even all of it, but it seemed like every hypothesis put forth was followed by misrepresentation of studies. Scientists were quoted as saying that possibly their study pointed towards such-and-such a conclusion, and then Gladwell took it and ran with it. That's not the case through out the book, but even if it only happens once, it casts doubt on the whole freaking thing. There were times I hated this and times I actually enjoyed it. In fact, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, more than I wanted to. For you see, this is the sort of thing feasted upon by ladder-climbing, power-lunchers, who want to put Gladwell's theories into practice for the purposes of creating their own wildfire word-of-mouth epidemic in the exalted name of the great and almighty greenback. That sort of greed, rising above the heads of most of humanity to serve the bloodsucking desires of one, is repellent. I guess I'm one of the few who didn't read this about 10 years or more back. I resisted for a while, but succumbed to peer pressure and misrepresentation of the book's content. Regardless, here I am. I've read it and probably you have too. So I ask you, is this shit or is it genius?

"This was a reread for me (15 years later) and it was interesting how my perspective on the information shifted somewhat. I didn't love the chapter about Goetz and NYC because I felt only certain factors were looked at in assessing the why's of what happened and the later clean up by the police. I felt only the factor of increased policing was looked at for the change in crime and not other farther reaching factors such as poverty, programs, and investments into communities. However the rest of the book stood about the same.

"Malcolm Gladwell has written five books, all of which have been on the New York Times bestseller list. He is extremely readable.This now-famous book is about popular ideas and products, and how they spread through society. Starting off small at first, they slowly gather momentum until they reach a 'tipping point', where they take off and become fantastically popular. This book is all about the mechanics of how this happens, and the different types of people and businesses enabling the process.The best bits for me? The illustration of how we are all incredibly different - how some people are freakishly sociable, others are freakishly knowing, informative and knowledgeable, whilst others have the charisma to sell you anything. Given Gladwell's clear examples I was easily able to slot a couple of my friends into these categories, and therefore relate to the ideas he was describing. These are the movers and shakers - the people who make things happen.He uses a wide range of phenomena to illustrate the idea of social epidemics - the rise to popularity of Hush Puppy shoes, a sudden decline of crime in New York, the success of the children's programmes Sesame Street and Blue Clues, the cleaning up of the New York subway, the spread of new corn seed in Iowa in the 1930s, an increase of suicides in the South Pacific islands of Micronesia, plus the reasons why smoking has drastically increased amongst teenagers in the US, despite strenuous efforts to discourage it. I was impressed by the wide range of his examples.My one criticism is that it was all rather predictable. The relationship between causes and effects were often ones I had heard before, or that I had worked out for myself. Unlike the book Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything I didn't feel that I was being exposed to some really original ideas behind society's statistics.Still - an interesting read by an excellent writer. It clarified several concepts I already had, and made them a lot less woolly.This entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.Show full review",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.038,0.836,0.126,0.984,Positive,,

"To understand ""The Tipping Point,"" one must understand what led to its creation: In the year 2000 A.D. (Anal Dominos), there were 5.5 billion people living on the planet Earth. Many of them were considered human beings, but a few were thought to be celery. The difference between the two categories bewildered the top dog breeders of the day. To help us think more deeply about the consequences of the problem, consider the following fact: If you were born after 1975 and tried to ride a bicycle from Iceland to Darfur, the chances of colliding with a British nanny increased 13% based on the number of Blossom reruns you watched as a child. Whether or not your parents are divorced is immaterial, as is the amount of padding in your seat. Social Scientists had a term for this late 20th century phenomenon: ""Whoa!"" Meanwhile, in Canada (if that's your real name), a young, mild-mannered boy named Malcolm recognized the unique power of combining individual letters into meaning-units called “words.” He quit his job making ice sculptures out of rusted fenders and moved south of the border to America (the nation, not the toy store). His timing was impeccable. At the end of the 90s, America had just entered a period of reckless behavior wherein, with little prompting, Americans would try to arrange words into ""sentences"" and, if sufficiently coked-up, slap those sentences into ""paragraphs."" Conservatives like Pat Buchanan were furious. Senator Bob Dole went on Meet the Press and blamed his erectile dysfunction on syntax. The era ended suddenly on December 31st, 1999, when, according to a budding bow-tie fanatic named Bill Nye, both the year AND the century had run their course. Feeling threatened, Gladwell went on national television to declare ""writing"" is the radical, counterintuitive explanation for the existence of what he called ""books"" but what conservatives called ""syphilis"". The strategy worked: He signed a contract with the biggest publishing house in America, which then promptly issued his first minor masterpiece: ""Writing: How Letters, Sentences, Paragraphs, and Chapters Add Up To The Thing That Came Before the Colon."" From that point on, it was all gin and roses (until Slash and Hypen left the band).",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.072,0.855,0.073,-0.7133,Negative,,
"موضوع: نقطه اوج، چه طور مسائل جزئی موجب تغییرات بزرگ می شوندخلاصه ای از محتویات: به طور کلی مالکوم گلدول، ژورنالیست مشهور نیویورکر در این کتاب علت وقوع اتفاقات اپیدمیک رو بررسی می کنه. اینکه تحت حضور چه شرایط و عواملی یک تبلیغ، یک شایعه، یا یک رویه در جامعه مد واپیدمیک می شه. از اطلاعاتی که در کتاب هست می شه در بحث های مارکتینگ و بازریابی، تبلیغات موثر استفاده کرد.خلاصه ای از جالبات کتاب:1. six degrees of separation: یکی از مطلب های جالبی که توی کتاب یاد گرفتم مفهوم شش درجه جدایی هست. به طول خلاصه طبق این تئوری، هر چیز یا شخصی که در دنیا وجود داشته باشه، با یک واسطه شش نفره از ذنجیره دوستان ما، و دوستان آن ها در دست رس ما خواهد بود. 2. Connectors: یکی از عوامل اپیدمیک شدن یک موضوع وجود افرادی با هویت رابط هست. این ها افرادی هستن با شبکه ای بزرگ از ارتباطات میان فردی. افرادی اجتماعی و خوش مشرب که معمولا مورد اعتماد و تحسین دوستانشون هستن. یک مثال خیلی جالب در خصوص این افراد این بود که می گه یک لیست 40 نفری از دوستانتون تهیه کنید و مشخص کنید چه طور با هر یک از این دوستانتون آشنا شدین، در نهایت به یک عدد کوچک می رسید. به این معنی که یکی یا دو نفر از دوستانتون موجب آشنا شدن شما با ما بقی افراد موجود در لیست دوسانتون هستن. این افراد همون اشخاص با هویت رابط هستند.3.  بر خلاف باور عموم مبنی بر اینکه انتخاب دوستانشون بر اساس ویژگی های مشترک هست، مطالعات و بررسی ها نشون می ده که ما دوستانمون رو بر اساس نزدیکی محیطی و اجتماعی انتخاب می کنیم. کسانی که فعالیت های مشترکی با اون ها داریم و نه ویژگی های مشترک. We're friends with the people we do things with, as much as we are with the people we resemble. We don't seek out friends, in other words. We associ­ate with the people who occupy the same small, physical spaces that we do.4.  Six degrees of separation doesn't mean that everyone is linked to everyone else in just six steps. It means that a very small number of people are linked to everyone else in a few steps, and the rest of us are linked to the world through those special few.5.  یکی دیگه از مطالبی که یاد گرفتم این بود که این دسته افرادی که با هویت رابط می شناسیم و دایره دوستان زیادی دارن آدم هایی هستن که ناخودآگاه معتقند که همه آدم هایی که قراره ببینن به یک نحوی فوق العاده و شگفت انگیزن و این طرز فکر باعث می شه زیبایی های آدم ها رو در حالی که از دید بقیه پنهان هست ببینن... جای بسی تامل داره این موضوع...6.  یک موضوع کاربردی و بسیار جالب دیگه در خصوص پیدا کردن شغل این هست که طبق آمار، اغلب افرادی که مشغول به کارهای رده بالا و خوب می شن اغلب شغلشون رو از طریق آشنایانشون (چه خیلی دور و چه خیلی نزدیک) پیدا می کنن که این مسئله اهمیت داشتن شبکه دوستان بزرگ رو مشخص می کنه. The strength of weak ties... Acquaintances, in short, represent a source of social power, and the more acquaintances you have the more power­ful you are.7.  The more close an idea a message come to a connector, the more probability that it spreads.8. Mavens: Those people who hoard knowledge if particular subjects and present them to anyone need that type of information merely out of goodwill which in turns make them popular and trustworthy.9. The broken window theory  این نظریه بسیار جالب می گه اگر یک پنجره ای شکسته بشه و تعمییر نشه، باعث می شه که به مرور پنجره های بیشتری شکسته بشن و این آغازی می شه برای گسترش بی نظمی و جرم. وجود کوچکترین نشانه از آلودگی یا بی نظمی و بی توجهی به اون باعث گسترش اون می شه. crime is the inevitable result of disorder. If a window is broken and left unrepaired, people walking by will conclude that no one cares and no one is in charge. Soon, more windows will be broken, and the sense of anarchy will spread from the building to the street on which it faces, sending a signalthat anything goes. 10.  the convictions of your heart and the actual contents of your thoughts are less important, in the end, in guiding your actions than the immediate context of your behavior11.  Peer influence and community influence are more important than family influence in determining how children turn out 12.  Caring about someone deeply is exhausting thus limiting us on the number of people we can mentally afford to heartily and truly care about.13. Transactive memory:  حافظه انتقالی به این معنی هست که ما مواردی در زندگیمون داریم مثل شماره تلفن، آدرس، یا مجموعه مواردی که باید بهشون رسیدگی کنیم که این ها رو در حافظه خودمون حفظ نمی کنیم، بلکه در جایی ذخیرشون می کنیم و آن جا را که نگهدارنده اون موارد هست به خاطر می سپاریم.مثلا مسائل زیادی هستن مثل یک تجربه یا یک نوع بازی یا محاوره که حفظ و نگهداریشون رو بر عهده شریک زندگیمون می سپاریم. به همین خاطر طلاق یا جدایی انقدر دردناک می شن، به این دلیل که دیگه به بخشی از اون خاطرات دست رسی نمی توانیم داشته باشیم. کلام آخر:  یک ستاره ای که کم شد از امتیازش به دلیل حجیم بودن کتاب بود که می تونست خیلی خلاصه تر باشه. البته این مورد بین اغلب کتاب ها مشترک هست که دلیلش مسائل اقتصادی و مالی هست بیشتر. اما در کل کتاب واقعا خواندنی و آموزنده ای بود، و از مطالعش لذت بردم.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.027,0.937,0.036,0.6996,Positive,,
"Malcolm Gladwell shows us with this book that he is a jack-of-all-trades (or intellectual disciplines) and master of none. He very loosely weaves together existing social science and economic research to support his thin idea that there is a ""tipping point"" in all epidemics. While it was a page turner and interesting to read, his glib conclusory statements interpreting others' research was a bit jarring... For example, use of the word ""always"" when describing a social phenomenon is not a practice to which most trained social scientists would subscribe. I was also hoping for more practical advice resulting from his work, but not much was to be found other than that many complex forces (people, context, etc.) are at work in achieving a tipping point in most epidemics.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,2.0,0.0,0.937,0.063,0.6956,Positive,,
"1 Start - Horrible book.Yes, yes, even though I started this yesterday I did actually finish it. And after doing so, I regret reading this. Full disclosure, the subject matter didn't really interest me but I've been wrong before so I gave it a go. I'll never be able to get back those precious reading hours.There are two things that make this book, in my opinion, unreadable. The first is that the concept/central theme of this book is nothing new. Now, I know this was published ca. 2000 so I'm about 17 years late to the party but come on. I can't imagine how this book struck a chord with so many people. The idea that there is some sort of tipping point (clever) that causes certain trends, ideas, etc. to become phenomenon's. To me that seems logical and a no-brainer. I mean, duh. There are certain elements that cause certain things to catch on while others don't. I just wasn't impressed with the author's fervor and excitement in trying to explain a logical thing. I felt as if he was talking down to the reader.The second thing that made me despise this book was that the author leaves a lot of half-thoughts. He rarely finishes an idea all the way to the end and the book is full of cases that are unfinished. He leaves one example before he's fully explained how it relates to his thesis and begins on another. I found it irritating and a bad way to write a book.I have Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by the same author and while I'll probably read it, I need to cool down from this one before I can jump into another one of his (what I presume will be horribly done) books.Do not read.",The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,Malcolm Gladwell,1.0,0.093,0.814,0.093,-0.269,Negative,,

"This is Gladwell's most thorough book. It has everything that I wanted from Outliers and Blink: research, diagnosis, and a clear call to action. Although admittedly, the research is not quite as fun as it is in his two following books. If I had Gladwell's attention, I would ask him this: How do you capitalize on your role as either a Connector, Maven, or Salesmen? And what if you are none of the above, but rather a part of the phenomenon-following mob? Can you aspire to a different role than the one you are naturally gifted with? I identified with the Maven, as I'm sure most journalists do. So what do I do with that beyond disseminating news and culture? Can a Maven be a trend setter or a Connector? Since I don't have Gladwell's attention, I guess that is rhetorical.One thing I love about Gladwell is that he presents strong theory and analysis in a way that allows for variance.

"من مدونتي: ثمانون كتابا بحثا عن مخرجhttps://saudomar.wordpress.com***طوال تاريخ الشرق الأوسط الحديث لم تشهد المنطقة أي ثورة حقيقية, لم يكن هناك سوى مظاهرات نادرة مبعثرة هنا وهناك. وفجاءة, ومن دون سابق إنذار, تندلع الثورات الواحدة تلو الأخرى في أرجاء المنطقة .. تونس .. مصر .. اليمن .. البحرين .. ليبيا .. المغرب .. والقادم مذهل أكثر.ليس من الصعوبة بمكان أن نحلل سبب نشوء كل ثورة من هذه الثورات على حدة, لكن الشيء الذي يستعصي على الفهم هو سبب حدوث كل هذه الثورات في هذه الفترة القصيرة ( حوالي خمسين يوماً ). ما لذي دفع بعجلة الثورة لأن تتدحرج بهذه السرعة الرهيبة من دولة لأخرى؟ هذا السؤال, في وجهة نظري, جوهري جداَ, ويستحق التأمل والتفكير مطولاً. إذا عرفنا السر, ما لذي يمنعنا من إعادة استخدام الوصفة لإستحداث ثورات جديدة على امتداد الوطن العربي؟ إن الشعوب العربية التي انقلبت على انظمتها السياسية المستبدة ما يزال أمامها طريق طويل, وما تزال بحاجة لأن تقوم بثورات أخرى لإصلاح التعليم, لإصلاح القضاء, لإصلاح القطاع الصحي, لإصلاح القيم الاجتماعية البالية, وغيرها, كي تصل للمكانة التي تبغيها لنفسها. يوم من الأيام, بعد أن تهدأ الثورات في الوطن العربي, سوف تجد الشعوب العربية نفسها أمام تحديات جديدة تستلزم تغييرات جذرية, وحينها سوف يكون السؤال الذي يتداوله الجميع: كيف نفعلها مرة ثانية؟كتاب ( نقطة التحول ) للكاتب الكندي ( مالكوم غلادويل ) كتاب بعيد كل البعد عن المجال السياسي, لكنه يقدم ثلاث قوانين لتفسير التغيرات التي تنتشر في أي مجتمع بشكل مفاجئ وسريع. هذه القوانين مرنة جداً, تستطيع استخدامها كي تحلل سبب انتشار الثورات العربية, كما تستطيع أن تستعملها لتفسير نجاح تقنيات معينة مثل الآي باد وفشل تقنيات أخرى مثل قوقل ويف, تستطيع استخدامها لفهم أسباب انخفاض أو ارتفاع معدلات الجريمة, تحليل نجاح الكتب والروايات الأكثر مبيعاً, شيوع موضة معينة, بل إنك تستطيع أن تستخدمها لفهم سبب الإقبال غير العادي للشعب السعودي على شراب ( الفيمتو ) في رمضان.قبل أن نستعرض هذه القوانين الثلاثة, لنبدء بسؤال يطرح نفسه حول عنوان الكتاب: ( ما هي نقطة التحول؟ ) أي تغيير يحدث في المجتمع يحدث عادة بشكل تدريجي وعلى فترة طويلة من الزمن. على سبيل المثال, في فترة ليست بعيدة في السعودية كان منظر الشخص الذي يربط حزام الأمان مثير للاستغراب ( وربما للضحك أحياناً ), وإن لم تخني الذاكرة بدأت الجهود تتركز على التوعية بحزام الأمان في عام 2000, ومنذ ذلك الحين ونحن نشهد زيادة طفيفة سنوياً في أعداد من يلتزمون بربط حزام الأمان. هذا هو التحول الطبيعي؛ تحول يحدث بشكل تدريجي وعلى فترة طويلة من الزمن. لكن من جهة أخرى, هناك تحولات اجتماعية تحدث في غضون فترة قصيرة جداً, وبشكل غير متوقع, مثل الثورات العربية الراهنة. لحظة الغليان التي تنقلب فيها الأمور رأساً على عقب فجاءة ومن دون أي سابق أنذار لتنتشر ظاهرة أو سلوك غير متوقع في المجتمع انتشار النار في الهشيم, هي اللحظة التي يسميها مالكوم غلادويل ( نقطة التحول ).مصطلح نقطة التحول ( The Tipping Point ) هو أساساً مصطلح يستخدمه علماء الأوبئة لوصف اللحظة الحرجة التي ينفجر فيها الوباء بشكل شنيع في المجتمع. عندما كان غلادويل يعمل كمراسل لصالح ( واشنطن بوست ) أسندت له مهمة تغطية انتشار وباء الإيدز, ومع احتكاكه بعلماء الأوبئة بدأ يذهل من الطريقة الغير مألوفه, والمخيفه, والتي يصعب التنبؤ بها لإنتشار الأوبئة. في عام 1982 حدثت نقطة تحول شنيعة لوباء الأيدز, فقد انتقل من كونه وباء يعاني منه أفراد قلة, لكونه وباء عالمي. هذه الحادثة, وهذا الوصف لها, جعل غلادويل يطرح فكرة أن لكل شيء, وليس فقط الأوب��ة, نقطة تحول. ما لذي يمنع, تساءل غلادويل, من أن يكون للأعمال التجارية, الموضة, الأفكار, التيارات, المنتجات, الإعلانات, نقطة تحول أيضاً؟الفكرة الأساسية التي يبني عليها غلادويل قوانينه الثلاثة لحدوث ( نقطة التحول ) هي في أن نتصور أفكار وسلوكيات المجتمع كأوبئة, ومثل الأوبئة, هذه الأفكار والسلوكيات لها خاصية الانتقال والعدوى. لذلك, يسمي غلادويل قوانينه ( القوانين الثلاثة للأوبئة ). دعونا الآن نتسعرض هذه القوانين.القانون الأول لإنتقال الفكرة أو السلوك في المجتمع اسمه ( قانون الأقلية ). ينص القانون الأول أن هناك أشخاص قليلون جداً في المجتمع بإمكانهم نقل العدوى ( الفكرة أو السلوك أو الرسالة ) أفضل من غيرهم. هناك ثلاث ملكات اجتماعية اذا امتلكها الشخص صار موصلاً فعالاً للعدوى, وهي: القدرة على الاقناع, القدرة على تكوين صلات اجتماعية, والقدرة على جمع المعلومات.القانون الثاني هو ( قانون عامل الإلتصاق ): محتوى الرسالة وطريقة عرضها تلعب دوراً أساسياً في انتشارها. من السهولة إيصال رسالتك للجماهير, لكن كيف تجعلهم يتذكرونها؟ كيف تجعلها ترسخ في أذهانهم؟ كيف تجعلهم يؤمنون بها؟ هذا هو التحدي الحقيقي, وهذا هو لب القانون الثاني.القانون الثالث هو ( قانون قوة السياق ): ينص على أن الظروف والأحوال المحيطة بالعدوى تلعب دوراً مهماً في انتشارها. حتى نستطيع أن نتصور كيف تعمل هذه القوانين الثلاثه, من الأفضل أن نربطها بالشكل التالي: القانون الأول هو قانون عن الشخص الذي ينقل الرسالة ( العدوى ) والقانون الثاني عن الرسالة نفسها, والقانون الثالث عن الظروف المحيطة بها.باستخدام هذه القوانين الثلاثة تستطيع أن تعيد النظر لتحلل الأفكار, والسلوكيات, والرسائل الذائعة في المجتمع لتفهم سبب ذيوعها, بل إنك تستطيع أن تستخدمها عن عمد لنشر أفكار معينة. في الطبعات اللاحقة من الكتاب, قام غلادويل بإلحاق فصل في أخر الكتاب اسمه ( دروس من العالم الحقيقي ) في هذا الفصل نشر غلادويل بعض محاولات القراء لتنفيذ نقاط تحول في بيئتهم ومجال أعمالهم.حقيقة أني, وبكل صراحة, أعتبر نفسي قد ظلمت كتاب ( نقطة التحول ) أشد الظلم حتى الآن. غلادويل ينال على المحاضرة الواحدة التي يلقيها أربعين ألف دولار, وقد باع من هذا الكتاب أكثر من مليونين نسخة حتى عام 2006, قبل أن تعود مبيعات للترتفع مرة أخرى بعض صدور كتابه التالي. صدقني, هذا الانتشار الغير عادي لم يكن لأن الناس تريد ان تعرف سبب انتشار السلوكيات والأفكار في المجتمع ( رغم أن هذا شيء مثير ) .. هناك أسباب مغايرة لشعبية غلادويل الجارفة.أسلوب غلادويل في الكتابة هو أسلوب من عالم أخر. غلادويل يؤسس فكرة الكتاب في البداية, ثم ينطلق بعد ذلك بسرد قصص قصيرة وأبحاث علمية متتالية عن اشياء غير مترابطة إطلاقاً ( في أحد الفصول تجده يتحدث عن برنامج الأطفال الشهير شارع السمسم والفصل التالي تجده يتحدث عن الثورة الأمريكية ) لكنك تجده في النهاية, وبشكل مدهش وعاصف للعقل, يجر حبلاً سحريا من مكان مجهول لتترابط كل هذه القصص لتدعم وتؤكد فكرة الكتاب الأساسية. إن أسلوبه في السرد لهو إعجازي بكل معنى الكلمة. إن كل من وجّه إنتقادات حاده لكتبه (بمن فيهم العالم والمؤلف الشهير ستيفن بانكر) لم يستطع ألا أن يعلن إنبهاره بهذا الأسلوب الساحر في الكتابة.إنني أتحداك الأن أن تفتح هذا الكتاب ( أو أي كتاب أخر له ) وأن تشير لسطر واحد ( فقط سطر واحد ) وتقول هذا سطر ممل. هذا الرجل باستطاعته ان يجعلك أن تنهي كتابه في جلسة واحدة من دون أن تشعر بوجودك. في الكوميديا هناك ما يعرف بسطر الخبطة (Punch Line) وهو عبارة عن الجملة التي تأتي في نهاية النكتة أو القصة كي تفاجأ الجمهور وتضحكهم ( وكأنها خبطة على رؤسهم ). كل قصة من قصص غلادويل تنتهي بسطر خبطة هستيري على رؤوس القراء؛ إما تحليل أو استنتاج أو إعادة تشكيل للقصة أو إبراز لعنصر خفي يتم بطريقة لا استطيع ان

"Here's Blink in a nutshell:Split decisions can be good; better than decisions where we take a lot of time to carefully weigh our options and use scientific evidence. Except when they're not.Rapid cognition is an exciting and powerful way to use your brain's quick, intuitive capabilities to make stunningly accurate decisions, and can even lead you to have better success in sports, business and politics. Except when it won't.We should learn to trust our snap judgments, even in seemingly complex situations where we don't have a lot of information.Except not really.Basically the book gives scientific and anecdotal evidence on why rapid cognition can be both a good and bad thing, without offering us much advise on how to tell the difference between situations where we should or shouldn't trust our instincts. There are many times when I felt that Gladwell contradicted himself. To support his ""rapid cognition is good"" section of the book, he uses an example of a psychological test where students were able to tell whether or not a professor was good at their job by simply watching a 5 second clip of them lecturing with the sound turned off. The results basically corresponded with impressions given by other students who spent an entire class with those professors - thus proving that there is some mysterious and powerful part of our subconscious that can make accurate snap judgments.But then later on in the book, in the ""rapid cognition is bad"" section, Gladwell warns us that, in general, people instantly like tall, attractive white people better than short, unattractive minorities.WELL DUH! OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS RATING THE PROFESSORS WERE BIASED BY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TALL, WHITE, OR ATTRACTIVE! Mystery solved!While Gladwell brings up some interesting concepts, his book never gels into a coherent whole.

"As an empirical psychologist by training, I get very annoyed at journalists who simplify things to the point that its no longer even remotely accurate. Such is the case for Blink. This is especially annoying to me, because the book describes my area of research specialization. If you're interested in a fun read, Gladwell is certainly an engaging author. If you're looking for something that accurately describes the research, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm GladwellThe author describes the main subject of his book as ""thin-slicing"": our ability to use limited information from a very narrow period of experience to come to a conclusion. The book begins with the story of the Getty Kouros (Archaic Greek sculptors reduced human anatomy and musculature in these statues to decorative patterning on the surface of the marble.), which was a statue brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. It was thought by many experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial responses were skeptical. For example, George Despinis, head of the Acropolis Museum in Athens, said ""Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that thing has never been in the ground"".عنوانهای

اندیشیدن میاندیشیم، درباره ی تصمیم‌هایی است، که در یک لحظه گرفته می‌شوند ــ در یک چشم به‌ هم زدن ــ؛ و همه ی این‌ها به آن سادگی‌ها که به‌ دیده می‌آیند، نیستند؛ چرا برخی از افراد، تصمیم‌ گیرهای والایی هستند، در حالی‌که برخی دیگر ناتوانند؟ چرا برخی پیرو غرایزشان هستند، و برنده می‌شوند، در حالی‌که عده‌ ای دیگر، در اشتباه، دست‌ و پا می‌زنند؟ مغز ما، واقعا در اداره، در کلاس، در آشپزخانه، و در خانه، چگونه کار می‌کند؟ و چرا اغلب بهترین تصمیمات، آن‌هایی هستند، که توضیحشان برای دیگران، ناممکن است؟ در کتاب «یک نگاه»، با روان‌شناسی آشنا می‌شویم، که می‌داند چطور با مشاهده ی چند دقیقه‌ ای صحبت زوج‌ها، طول زندگی زناشویی آن‌ها را، پیش‌بینی کند؛ مربی تنیسی، که می‌داند، پیش از اصابت راکت با توپ، آیا بازیکن خطا می‌کند، یا خیر؛ متخصصان عتیقه‌ شناسی، که با یک نگاه، اصل بودن، یا تقلبی بودن آن شی‌ء را، تشخیص می‌دهند؛ هم‌چنین شکست‌های بزرگ، قضاوت در یک نگاه نیز، در این کتاب شرح داده می‌شوند: انتخاب «وارن هاردینگ»؛ تولید کوکای جدید؛ و کشتن «دیالو» توسط پلیس را؛ کتاب «یک نگاه» فاش می‌کند، که تصمیم‌ گیرنده‌ های بزرگ، آن‌هایی نیستند، که بیشترین اطلاعات را فرآوری می‌کنند، یا بیشترین زمان را، صرف اندیشیدن می‌نمایند، بلکه کسانی هستند، که هنر تمام عیار «برش نازک» را، دارند، یعنی از بین انواع ویژگیهای مربوط به یک مسئله، اصلی‌ترین آن‌ها را جدا می‌کنندنقل نمونه متن: (پیش درآمد: مجسمه ای که اصل نبود؛ در سپتامبر سال1983میلادی، یک دلال آثار هنری به نام «جیان فرانکو به چینا» به موزه «پاول گتی کالیفرنیا» مراجعه کرد؛ او ادعا میکرد، مجسمه مرمرینی در اختیار دارد، که متعلق به شش سده پیش از میلاد است؛ این مجسمه معروف به «کورس» بود ـ مجسمه ای از یک مرد جوان برهنه ایستاده، با دستانی از دوطرف آویخته، و پای چپ جلو نهاده؛ تا آن زمان در حدود دویست مجسمه کورسی از حفاریهای باستانشناسی، یا گورهای قدیمی به دست آمده بود، که اغلب آنها در هنگام اکتشاف، یا متلاشی شده بودند، و یا بدجوری آسیب دیده بودند، اما این یکی تقریبا سالم مانده بود؛ ارتفاع این مجسمه نزدیک به دومتر و بیست و پنج سانتیمتر بود، و شفافیتی داشت که آن را از بقیه مجسمه های اکتشافی متمایز میکرد؛ این یک کشف خارق العاده بود، و مبلغ پیشنهادی «به چینا» زیر ده میلیون دلار بود؛ موزه «گتی» با احتیاط وارد عمل شد؛ مجسمه «کورس» را به امانت گرفت، و تحقیق دقیقی را شروع کرد؛ آیا مجسمه با بقیه مجسمه های کورسی همخوانی داشت؟ جواب به ظاهر آری بود؛ شیوه ی ساخت آن به نظر مشابه مجسمه «کورس آناویسوس» در موزه ملی باستان شناسی «آتن» بود، و معنایش این بود که با زمان و مکان خاصی مطابقت داشت؛ این مجسمه از کجا و چه زمانی پیدا شده بود؟ هیچکس به طور دقیق نمیدانست؛ اما «به چینا» مدارکی به اداره حقوقی موزه «گتی» ارائه داد، که حاوی تاریخچه اخیر آن بود؛ طبق مدارک موجود، «کورس» از سال1930میلادی، در کلکسیون خصوصی یک پزشک «سوییسی» به نام «لوفن برگر» نگهداری میشد، که خود او نیز آن را از دلال معروف آثار هنری «یونانی» به نام «روسس» خریده بود؛ برای بررسیهای دقیق، زمین شناسی به نام «استنلی مارگولیس» از دانشگاه «کالیفرنیا» به موزه آمد، و به مدت دو روز سطح مجسمه را با یک استریو میکروسکوپ بسیار حساس مورد آزمایش قرار داد، و بعد از زیر زانوی راست مجسمه، تکه ای به قطر یک سانتیمتر و طول دو سانتیمتر جدا کرد، و با استفاده از میکروسکوپ الکترونی، اشعه انکساری ایکس و اشعه فلورسنسی ایکس به تجزیه آن پرداختمارگولیس به این نتیجه رسید، که مجسمه از سنگ مرمر «دُلومیت» معدن قدیمی «کیپ وتی» در جزیره «تاسوس» ساخته شده، و سطح مجسمه با لایه ی نازکی از کربنات آهک پوشیده شده است ــ که به گفته وی از اهمیت خاصی برخوردار بود ــ زیرا «دُلومیت» تنها در طول قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند تبدیل به کربنات آهک شود؛ به عبارت دیگر مجسمه شیئی قدیمی بود و تقلبی نبودموزه «گتی» از این مسئله خشنود بود، و چهارده ماه پس از شروع تحقیقات، با خریدن مجسمه موافقت شد؛ در پاییز سال1986میلادی مجسمه برای اولین بار به نمایش گذاشته شد؛ «نیویورک تایمز» حکایت آنرا در صفحه ی اول خود آورد؛ چند ماه بعد، متصدی اموال عتیقه ی موزه، «ماریون ترو»، گزارشی پرشور و بلندبالا از دستیابی موزه به مجسمه، برای مجله برلینگتون نوشت «اکنون کورس با قامتی برافراشته و دستانی مشت شده حیات مطمئن خویش را که برترین خصلت او و برادرانش است ابراز میکند.» و سپس پیروزمندانه نتیجه گیری کرد «او چه خدا باشد و چه انسان تجسم کامل نیروی تابناک بلوغ هنری غرب است.»؛ با تمام این احوال، مشکلی وجود داشت؛ مجسمه به نظر اصل نمیآمد، اولین کسیکه به این مشکل اشاره کرد، فردی بود به نام «فدریکو زِری»، مورخ هنرشناس «ایتالیایی»، که عضو هیئت امنای موزه نیز بود؛ وقتی «زِری» در دسامبر سال1983میلادی به محل نگهداری مجسمه رفت، تا آن را ببیند، بی اختیار به ناخنهای آن خیره شد؛ البته نمیخواست توضیحی برای این مسئله بدهد، اما به نظرش یک جای کار ایراد داشت؛ نفر بعدی «اِوِلین هریسون»، یکی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های «یونانی» بود، که هنگام معامله نهایی، در «لس آنجلس» بود؛ او چنین به خاطر میآورد: آن زمان «آرتور هافتن» متصدی موزه بود، و ما را برای بازدید برد؛ او با یک حرکت پارچه روی مجسمه را پس زد و گفت، «خُب، این هنوز مال ما نیست اما تا چند هفته دیگر خواهد شد.»؛ و من گفتم: «خیلی متاسفم که این را میشنوم.»، «هریسون» چه دیده بود؟ خودش نمیداند؛ در همان لحظه اول، وقتی «هافتن» پارچه را کنار زده بود، آنچه «هریسون» حس کرده بود، یک الهام بود، یک احساس غریزی از اینکه چیزی آن وسط اشکال داشت؛چند ماه بعد «هافتن»، «تامس هاوینگ» مدیر سابق موزه «متروپولتین» را برای بازدید از مجسمه، به کارگاه مرمّت موزه برد؛ «هاوینگ» همیشه اولین کلمه ای را که با دیدن چیزی از ذهنش میگذرد یادداشت میکند؛ و هرگز فراموش نمیکند اولین کلمه ای که با دیدن «کورس» از ذهنش گذشت چه بود؛هاوینگ میگوید: آن کلمه «تازه» بود ــ «تازه»، و «تازه» برای مجسمه ای که دوهزار سال قدمت دارد کلمه مناسبی نیست.؛ «هاوینگ» بعدها که راجع به آن لحظه فکر کرد، فهمید چرا چنین کلمه ای به ذهنش خطور کرده بود: «من در سیسیلی حفاری کرده بودم، جاییکه تکه ها و قطعاتی از این دست پیدا میشوند، اما این یکی به هیچ کدام شبیه نبود؛ به نظر میرسید این مجسمه کورس از توی یکی از همین قوطیهای قهوه مرغوب استارباکس بیرون آمده باشد!»؛ «هاوینگ» رو به «هافتن» پرسید، «آیا برای آن پولی هم پرداخته اید؟» و وقتی با چهره متعجب «هافتن» مواجه شد، گفت، «اگر پرداخته اید سعی کنید پس بگیرید و معامله را فسخ کنید.»؛ مسئولان موزه «گتی» کم کم داشتند نگران میشدند، بنابراین سمپوزیوم ویژه ای در مورد کورس در یونان برپا کردند؛ مجسمه را بسته بندی کردند و به یونان فرستادند، و از متخصصان ارشد مجسمه شناسی دعوت کردند؛ اینبار زمزمه یاس و دلهره بلندتر به گوش میرسید؛ «هریسون» در کنار مردی ایستاده بود که نامش «جرج دِس پینیس» بود، و رئیس موزه «آرکوپولیس آتن»؛ «جرج دس پینیس» نگاهی به کورس انداخت و رنگش پرید؛ او رو به هریسون گفت: «هر کس یکبار در عمرش مجسمه ای را که از دل خاک بیرون کشیده شده، دیده باشد میتواند تشخیص دهد، این یکی زیرزمین نبوده است.» «جورجیوس دانتاس»، رئیس جمعیت باستانشناسی آتن، به محض اینکه مجسمه را دید تنش یخ کرد؛ او گفت: «وقتی برای اولین بار کورس را دیدم احساس کردم انگار شیشه ای بین من و مجسمه کشیده شده است.»؛در سمپوزیوم، «آنجلوس دِلی وریاس» مدیر موزه «بناکی آتن» نیز گفته های «دانتاس» را تایید کرد؛ او به تفصیل از تناقض بین سبک ساخت مجسمه، و این واقعیت که مرمر آن از معادن تاسوس استخراج شده است، صحبت کرد، و سپس به اصل مطلب رسید؛ چرا او فکر میکرد که مجسمه تقلبی است؟ زیرا وقتی برای اولین بار به آن نگاه انداخته بود موجی از ادراک و دافعه ی حسی در او برانگیخته شده بود؛ زمانیکه سمپوزیوم به پایان رسید در بین اکثر مدعوین این اتفاق نظر وجود داشت، که کورس ابدا آن چیزی نیست که تصور میشدموزه «گتی» با تمامی متخصصان و وکلای خود و ماهها بررسی دقیق به یک نتیجه رسیده بود، و برخی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی ــ تنها با یک نگاه و احساس دافعه حسی ــ به نتیجه ای دیگر؛ حق با کدام یک بود؟ برای مدتی هیچ چیز مشخص نبود؛ کورس تبدیل به مسئله ای شده بود که متخصصان هنری در کنفرانسهای مختلف بر سر آن بحث و جدل میکردند؛ اما بعد، اندک اندک، ابهامات ماجرای گتی شروع به روشن شدن نمود؛ برای مثال نامه هایی که وکلای گتی به دقت پیگیری کرده بودند و مشخص میکرد که کورس متعلق به یک پزشک سوییسی بوده، جعلی از آب درآمد؛ یکی از نامه هایی که به تاریخ سال1952میلادی بود دارای یک کدپستی بود، که تا بیست سال پس از آن تاریخ هنوز وجود خارجی نداشت؛ نامه دیگری که تاریخ سال1955میلادی را داشت، به یک حساب بانکی اشاره داشت، که تا تاریخ سال1963میلادی هنوز افتتاح نشده بود؛ در اصل نتیجه ی ماهها تحقیق فقط این شد که کورس موزه «گتی» همان سبک مجسمه «آناویسوس» را داشت، اما این نتیجه گیری نیز مورد شک بود؛هرچه متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی، دقیقتر به آن نگاه میکردند، بیشتر به التقاطی بودن آن پی میبردند؛ هر قسمت از اندام مجسمه مربوط به زمان و مکان متفاوتی بود؛ اندام باریک مرد جوان بیشتر شبیه «کورس تنه آ» بود که در موزه «مونیخ» نگهداری میشد، و موهای خوش حالتش شبیه کورس موزه متروپولتین نیویورک؛ و در این بین پاهایش چیزی نبودند جز هنر مدرن، از قضا این مجسمه از همه بیشتر شبیه مجسمه شکسته و کوچکتری بود، که در سال1990میلادی، توسط یک هنرشناس «بریتانیایی» در «سوییس» پیدا شده بود؛ هر دو مجسمه از یک سنگ مرمر مشابه و با یک سبک تراشیده شده بود؛ اما کورس سوییسی متعلق به گذشته نبود، بلکه در اوایل دهه هشتاد در کارگاهی در رم ساخته شده بود؛ پس تحقیقات علمی که مشخص میکرد سطح مجسمه کورس، تنها پس از قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها، میتواند به چنین شکلی درآید؛ خوب آن نتایج همچندان قطعی نبودند؛ طبق آزمایشها و بررسیهای بعدی زمینشناس دیگری به این نتیجه رسید، که با استفاده از کپک سیب زمینی، میتوان در عرض چند ماه سطح مجسمه مرمر «دلومیتی» را به شکل کهنه و قدیمی درآورد؛ در کاتالوگ موزه «گتی» تصویری از مجسمه «کورس» چاپ شده که زیر آن نوشته شده «حدود پاصد و سی سال قبل از میلاد، یا، مدرن جعلی.»؛ زمانیکه «فدریکو زری» و «اِوِلین هریسون» و «تامس هاوینگ» و «جورجیوس دانتاس» ــ و خیلیهای دیگر ــ با یک نگاه به مجسمه دچار دافعه حسی شدند مطمئنا حق داشتند؛ آنها در همان دو ثانیه اول ـ در یک نگاه ـ به شناختی از ماهیت مجسمه دست یافتند که تیم تخصصی موزه «گتی» پس از چهارده ماه تحقیق هنوز به آن نرسیده بود؛ یک نگاه کتابی است درباره ی همان دو ثانیه نخست)؛ پایان

"Blink
 is- what all the stories, case studies, and arguments add up to- an attempt to understand the magical and mysterious thing called Judgement. Its basic premise is: split second decisions (snap judgements); how they can be good and bad. Gladwell suggests split-seconds decisions are better than the decisions where we take considerable time to weigh our choices and options. He points out that our mind figure things, people, et al. in a blink of an eye. And it is often that these snap judgements are much more trustworthy than judgements arrived at rationally. But he does not stop here and goes on further: snap judgements can be misleading, too; he termed it Warren Harding error. He suggested that there are some instinctive processes that prevent us to see clearly; and hence cloud our judgements. Blink is an interesting read. It is very well written, and at the same time engages your attention from the start. And writing is reader friendly, perfectly suitable for a layman.",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.058,0.773,0.169,0.9658,Positive,,
"I think this book wins my prize for Most Easily Misinterpreted to Serve Personal Agendas. Gladwell gets so into the interesting details of the case he's building, he really doesn't emphasize the final conclusions of the book at all, leaving people to think that the interesting details are the whole point, which is unfortunate. But then again, I'm not 100% sure I got the whole point.Most of the folks I know think that this book is about how a person's gut instincts can be a better read of a situation than a read based on thorough study. Which is an idea that most people love, since they don't want to have to do all that boring study anyhow. What's missing from that analysis is that Gladwell later insists (but only at the very end of the book, and almost in passing) that it's the thorough active training and study of a subject that allow a person to have ""true"" or ""correct"" gut reads. The guy who can tell who's getting divorced after 60 seconds of hearing them talk spent years coding verbal and physical cues in couples, studying them intensely for years before he was able to give his 60 second analysis. The art historians were drawing on a vast body of knowledge when they made their judgment about the statue. The cop who read fear instead of aggression and didn't shoot couldn't name what he was seeing, but he'd seen it before. Then he also says that our gut reactions can be easily colored by training we don't even know is there- our prejudices, whether unknown or unacknowledged- influence or reads of a situation as well.Ultimately, I saw this book as a reaction to and analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, with some tips for how to avoid such future tragedies. In that light, I thought it was interesting and even constructive, but only if you pay close attention to the last chapter.",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.106,0.794,0.099,-0.3793,Negative,,
"I would put this book in the category of ""Freakonomics"" and ""The Tipping Point."" By the same author as the latter title, Malcolm Gladwell, the purpose of this book is to weigh the advantages as well as the disadvantages of the power of the mind's ability to unconsciously leap to conclusions based on what is seen in the proverbial blink of an eye. While I have read some negative reviews of Gladwell's book, mostly citing that he fails to inform the reader how to know when to go with your gut and when not to, as well as arguments that he urges readers not to follow their gut when the gut instincts are politically incorrect, I have to disagree with many of them. I think that Gladwell's objective in ""Blink"" is to make the reader simply aware of their gut instincts and to urge them to consider trusting it more frequently than we do. People tend to make decisions that are supported by a litany of rationalizations and explanations, but do we always really have reasons for why we do or think what we do? Gladwell is arguing that we don’t, and that sometimes it takes the unconscious mind to make those decisions for us. On the flip side, he also argues that sometimes we unconsciously make negative decisions based on that same quick judgment and our predetermined stereotypes, such as with people of other sexes or other races than ourselves. “Blink” was a very complicated book with many facets and it’s hard to explain all of them or review them all without writing an essay. In the end, I think the main goal isn’t perfect knowledge of the subject of thinking without thinking, but rather consideration of it and how it can benefit us or hinder us both individually and as a society.",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.074,0.867,0.059,-0.6956,Negative,,
"O, to have the writing career of Malcolm Gladwell. The man pulls interesting case studies from academic research and news headlines, spins it into a book under a general theme, and blammo! He has a bestseller. This formula worked for him with The Tipping Point and then Blink. Blink is a compelling read, despite its weak overall theme, which is that sometimes split-second decisions are good and sometimes they're bad, and we need to learn when to trust our first impressions and when to discount them (except there's no real way to make that distinction). The book is a pleasure to read simply because of its case studies. Gladwell throws in so many topics — art, politics, marriage, consumer testing, athletes, war, police shootings, music — that there is bound to be something engaging for everyone. (After reading another one of Gladwell's peppy articles in The New Yorker, my husband joked, ""Gladwell thinks he can make ANYTHING seem interesting."")After finishing Blink, I feel like I've learned something important, but I'm not sure exactly what, other than that Gladwell has a very charmed career.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.044,0.833,0.123,0.8858,Positive,,
"I generally distrust anyone who says that they ‘go-with-their-gut’. But when the company I work for announced a major decision a few years back, I instantly said, “This is going to be a huge mistake.” Smart people had examined the deal backwards and forwards for months and thought it was a great idea. I had a bad feeling about it that I could only later explain, and I was far from the only one. And we were right. The entire thing turned out to be a huge disaster. I kept thinking about that incident when I read Blink. The book has a pretty obvious point. People make snap decisions that they can’t consciously explain. Sometimes these decisions are correct and amazing based on the limited amount of information available. Art experts who instantly know a statue is fake despite scientific tests indicating otherwise. A fireman who appears to be fighting a routine small fire suddenly orders his men out without really knowing why and the floor collapses a second later. And sometimes these decisions can be wrong and have tragic consequences. Four cops think a guy has a gun when he’s pulling his wallet out and shoot him multiple times.We’ve all made quick decisions and later been amazed at how good or bad they turned out, but what makes Blink interesting is that Gladwell does some examination of the science behind how we arrive at these conclusions, and his thoughts on how the data we’re processing can either give us incredible insight or lead us horribly wrong.Thankfully, Gladwell is not making an argument against logical thinking or analyzing a problem. What he is doing is pointing out that instinct or intuition can be a powerful tool IF the people involved have trained themselves to make good decisions, and if we know when to trust it. He’s got a lot of great examples of doctors, military officers and police officers who often have to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds with limited information. They have to trust their instincts, and Gladwell makes some common sense points that the right kind of training and education can make a huge difference. He contrasts the story of the four New York cops who killed the guy with a wallet versus a patrolman who did not fire on someone who actually had a gun but was attempting to surrender it.What made this book fun to read was the variety of examples that Gladwell uses and the scientific research done with them. Art dealers, doctors, marriage counselors, cops, military officers, car salesmen, a tennis coach, and classical musicians are all used as examples of the strengths and weaknesses of snap decisions.

"so i bought this book in boston's logan airport about 10 minutes before i had to board a flight to seattle. the bookstore was limited; i didn't want to have to work to get interested. and the first 100 pages or so did the trick... until i realized that gladwell wasn't so much building an argument as telling stories about a certain topic. don't get me wrong, i finished the book. later. back in boston, on the T. and it did cover some interesting studies, or i wouldn't have done so. but i suspect the author might've lacked the attention span necessary to lend this book any coherence. meh. it was basically a series of loosely related tidbits about snap-judgments, none of which led me to conclude that instinct or intuition is significantly more or less reliable than rational deliberation. if a point could be gleaned and summarized, i guess it would be that with the right thin-slice of information, under the right conditions, instantaneous judgements can be spot-on. shrug. the best i can say about this book is that there were a couple of well-set-up digs at the bush administration and i discovered the music of kenna, who's pretty cool. i also learned that when my girlfriend's eyes get even a little wider, it means she's angry.",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,2.0,0.061,0.849,0.091,0.8247,Positive,,
"This was a big best-seller for Gladwell. He posits that much of the time we make decisions, reach conclusions in a sort of pre-conscious manner that he calls “thin-slicing.” That means taking a very small sample, a thin slice, and making a decision immediately based on that information. However, it is the case that the ability to evaluate that slice is fed by a lifetime of experience. It is not simply, as some, including President Bush the second, might believe, that using one’s gut, in the absence of years and years of preparation, is as valid a way of reaching decisions as taking the longer route of careful analysis of available data.

"Elsewhere, in one of my other recent reviews, a GoodReads friend (Richard) told me that he had become less infatuated with this book after reading a review by a specialist in the field who gave it a drubbing. I was worried that knowing this might ruin this book for me – but it has not. I really enjoyed this one too. This is the third of Gladwell’s books I’ve read in quick succession and this contained lots of information about things that have made me think and sparked my interest to learn more. It may well be that Gladwell’s style does not appeal to an expert in the field – and that is quite likely to be true, but I’ve found that it is often the case that I’ve been introduced to themes by popularisers and later went on to read more deeply on a subject. I rarely condemn those who introduce me to fascinating topics – and this is a fascinating topic.I’m not going to do a full review, but rather quickly talk about wine. While he was talking about coke and about taste tests I was thinking about wine. He makes the point that when asked to judge jam people do nearly as well as the experts if they are just asked which jam they liked the most, but do much worse than experts if asked to explain why they graded them in the order that they did. That is, if they have to talk about texture and sweetness and citrus flavours – people change how they judge jam and end up picking the worst jam rather than the best. This is because we don’t really know what ‘texture’ is and so trying to slot jams into categories that we don’t really understand means we are most likely to stuff up and confuse ourselves. Now, wine. I wonder if anyone has ever done a test at cellar doors to see what people end up buying and if they pick the nicest wine for the price, or do they buy vinegar instead? I wouldn’t mind betting that there would be something similar happening here – and if you are with someone who says things like, “Oh yes, fruity, but with a back-taste of coal tar” you might end up buying something that is quite disgusting. You know, unless you actually have some idea of what you are talking about, it might be best to shut up and drink the wine.That is the point of this book – learning when to trust your “immediate reactions” and when to question them. I think there is much in this book that is worth knowing and much that is fascinatingly interesting. (The stuff about unconscious racism is so important that everyone should be forced to read this for that alone). But with Richard, I am a little concerned that an expert in the field didn't like this book. All the same, the expert does recommend Made to Stick so I guess that can be the next book I read.There is – as is proven by Dylan Moran – only one way to pick wine:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2gGf...",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.062,0.798,0.14,0.9932,Positive,,
"Much like the reason behind my majoring in Economics, I like Gladwell because he opens my mind to new ideas and new ways to think. Much like Economics, I believe he's far from perfect, but I really enjoy viewing the world through his lens. In just about anything, when people start acting as if there is only one way to do something, I stop listening to them. This goes for many things, but especially politics. If you DO, however, find someone who is omniscient and knows exactly how every policy will turn out in the end, please let me know. I may listen to their one way of seeing the world. Otherwise ...What I got from Blink is that there is a lot to our instant thoughts and feelings and many times much more than we give them credit. The traditional wisdom is to plan and make huge weighty decisions based on every single bit of information that we have at our fingertips (which is just about everything, google!). This is actually a big reason my wife and I get into ... disagreements (we'll go with that). She likes to plan everything down to the last detail and I like to be a bit more relaxed.So it would seem that this book is a big proponent of my way of doing things, but it turns out it's not so much.We should trust our gut-instinct, says Blink, if we have many hours of experience in said realm of understanding because we have developed the skills to make sense of those small details and because we have the ability to ""thin slice."" Gladwell also makes the point that not always can we trust our gut-intinct, however, because our gut-instinct tends to be racist, even when we are not in fact consciously racist. Also, our instincts can get overwhelmed by heightened arousal, such as when people can't even dial 911 in an emergency because their senses are overloaded.But then again, you can practice and have these types of unconscious reactions mitigated.The interesting story-telling style of introducing these topics is, of course, what really gets me. It's the stories that are often unbelievable that have me clamoring for more, just like in Outliers (although I think Outliers was a little better written) and I would assume his other books. He goes into why The Getty art museum spent millions on a fake kouros (Greek statue) and why cops probably aren't racial profiling when they beat people like Rodney King, but because of a few key mistakes such as allowing their unconscious to get overwhelmed and also because they were a group of officers instead of just one.He talks about people who can listen to a couple and tell when they should start talking to their lawyers and people who have developed the actual abilities that are shown in the TV show ""Lie to Me."" How looking at a person's room for 5 minutes may give a complete stranger a better picture of a person than a good friend. I've always loved these types of explanations for things. There's the old wisdom we have and the wisdom we assume when we don't have any other way to describe a particular event and which is completely wrong. I love thinking new ideas, even when it's old news and that's why I'll keep coming back to Gladwell.",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.052,0.79,0.158,0.9964,Positive,,

We’re a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don’t really have an explanation for.Blink is an interesting book, full of examples of situations when you would be better off trusting your snap judgment over a long, well-reasoned approach. It’s counterintuitive, and it seems like research may continue to flesh out which items are the ones that should be processed by snap decision (such as the book’s heart attack diagnosis example).

"I didn't learn much from this book that I did not already know. I am beginning to suspect that Malcolm Gladwell is not writing books that uncover valuable facts that we should know, but rather is writing books that restate facts we already know but in an interesting way.I like his anecdotal stories very much which is why I finished the book - hoping for more stories. When he lays out the facts, though, his writing is no more interesting than any other scientific author. So, in summary, what we have is a talented writer making certain scientific findings available to a much wider audience than usual. Bravo! However if you want to learn something new, this book or his previous effort, The Tipping Point, is not where to go to find it. I imagine, if I read it, I will find The Outliers, his latest effort, to be similarly constructed.Blink's content is easily summarized. First impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. Be careful, though, because first impressions can be troublesome because of people's prejudices. Got it in 254 pages. He does come up with an interesting term, ""thin slicing"", to describe the process of taking in a first impression.

"I reread this after realizing I couldn't remember enough to compare with Kahneman`s book. They are mostly aligning, only Kahneman suggests against making snap judgements and relying more on evidence whereas Gladwell gives views from both sides and stays impartial.Blink is about unconscious decision making. Our unconscious side is fascinating, because it seems to be the one that holds the strings most of the time; making very fast decisions, watching out for any threat to our existence. However when our drives (the motivators of unconscious) are in conflict, ourrational mind is quick to get in. The rational mind is also there to make corrections, and making plans. So it seems that mostly we are on autopilot for unimportant things, and also when we have to do something at lightening speed. But at other times even if there is an urge to act instinctively, one should act relying on data rather than on instinct.",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.036,0.95,0.015,-0.3071,Negative,,

"Exciting cutting edge neuroscience and psychology pitched at a level designed to drop a layman’s jaw!BLINK is about first impressions, unconscious thought, data accumulation at a glance, snap judgments and spontaneous, instantaneous high-speed decision making!In the first chapter, Gladwell summarizes his threefold purpose of writing the book. His first purpose was to convince readers that high speed decisions can be “every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.” His second purpose was to demonstrate that when those snap judgments and first impressions go off the rails, they do so for a very specific set of quite understandable reasons that are obvious enough on their face to allow decision makers to be on their guard when necessary. Gladwell’s final objective, obviously I dare say, was to convince readers that learning the difference and developing the skill of harking to those snap judgments when it’s appropriate to do so is a learnable skill.From first page to last, Gladwell’s descriptions of the science, the psychological tests that were used to bolster the scientific conclusions and the anecdotal examples of instances where snap judgments took the day or, ultimately, failed miserably were, in a word, gripping.For instance, Gladwell’s description of the degree to which facial movements are inextricably linked to emotions is mind-blowing. I dare you to NOT stop and shake your head in dumbfounded amazement when you read, “The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process.” Think about that for just a second. Facial expressions not only reflect emotions that already exist. They can create emotions and enhance or depress already existing feelings. You certainly won’t be hearing me expressing any disbelief when I read about a canny detective’s ability to pick up on kinesic “tells” about lying or information withholding during an interrogation any more.BLINK has lots and lots of succulent meat to chew on – recognition of forged artwork; wartime leadership and decision-making in the heat of battle; the differences between normal perception and autistic perception; judging on appearance; why Coca-Cola made the spectacularly flawed decision to create New Coke; a policeman’s near instantaneous decision to shoot a suspect; and much, much more.Highly recommended (and THAT, by the way, was NOT a snap decision!)Paul Weiss",Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.066,0.844,0.09,0.6686,Positive,,

"I was really expecting more from this book. I've heard mostly good things about Gladwell, and he had a pretty interesting TED talk, and I enjoy almost anything to do with the brain, so...why not?The book certainly brought up a lot of interesting ideas and did a good job of discussing the different elements that go into the snap decisions that we make every day. And it's probably worth a read for many of the stories and experiments related. But for the most part this book really failed to impress. More than that though, it failed at being a coherent analysis of what goes on in the human brain when we make snap judgments. Gladwell alternates between telling us to trust and accept this ""mysterious phenomena"" that allows us to make these unconscious snap judgments and warning us against the use of these snap judgments. One moment he advises against the idea that we need to slowly collect data and weigh options to make the most informed opinion and provides examples where too much thinking and information leads us astray, and in the next moment gives us examples of how snap judgments sometimes go horribly wrong. And he leaves us with no clear sense of how to use this new found information to make better decisions and judgments in our own lives. Do I trust my insights because my rational brain will fool me, or do I mistrust my instincts because of the inherent bias contained within them? If Gladwell knows he sure didn't tell me.One example of somewhere where I think he didn't analyze the situation enough was when he talked about the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (pick cards from one of two decks, one deck tends towards bad and the other towards good outcomes). He focused solely on how the unconscious mind was aware of the pattern (which deck was bad and which was good) long before the conscious mind was aware of it when making decisions. And this was shown by the fact that sweating occurred when choosing from the ""bad"" deck before the subject knew why (or was even aware of it). What he fails to mention about all this is that the reason for this is because we are designed to be ""risk averse"". It is not because we are making brilliant snap judgments, or that our brains have ""learned"" the rules before we are aware of it. From an evolutionary perspective it pays off more to learn from our mistakes than learn from our victories. Mistakes are costly. This is why bad memories are more salient than happy ones. The sweating that occurs is a physiological indicator of and means of prompting the organism to stay away. It's not even that this explanation is in contradiction to Gladwell's; it is that it IS an explanation for the phenomena Gladwell describes, one easily at Gladwells' disposal. Two other aspects of this book stuck out as major frustrations for me:1) Gladwell spends a lot of time early on talking about the mysterious nature of our ability to thin slice (make accurate snap judgments based on very little information) and urges us to accept this. To his credit, he does attempt to demystify this somewhat later on, but not enough in my opinion. His first example is of a museum that purchased an expensive sculpture which all the data and scientists evaluated as legitimate, but which experts in the field immediately saw as a fake without being able to put into words why. It's purposefully misleading to label this as some sort of mysterious phenomena. For instance, it's important to remember that these people were experts. An amateur would not and could not make this same snap judgment because they don't have the training to. This ability didn't magically appear, it came from learning and training and synaptic change. These experts learned over time. They studied types of stone, and different styles, and everything else that goes into understanding their field. And this process created memories...synaptic change within their brains. And there exists a system (or systems) in the brain that can make decisions based on that neuronal structure without conscious awareness. Shortcuts so to speak. But these shortcuts are a product of that neuronal structure, which is a product of that synaptic change, which is a product of the learning the individual did over time. It's misleading to call this mysterious. What's important, and more interesting in my opinion, is figuring out the underlying processes that allow this to happen. 2) Towards the end of the book Gladwell discusses how our stress response leads us to make all sorts of bad decisions. He talks about autism and how autistic people can't mind read (don't have theories of other minds) and how this affects their interpretation of events around them and of the world in general. He compares what happens to people in stressful situations to this, that during these situations, because the fight or flight response has taken over, people have tunnel vision and can no longer ""read minds"" and thus make all sorts of mistakes and bad decisions because they are focusing on the wrong things. My issue is that he, incomprehensibly, makes a literal, as opposed to metaphorical, connection with autism. He argues that during these times we become ""temporarily autistic"". While it's true that one aspect of our behavior becomes similar to an aspect of an autistic individuals behavior during these times, it seems like a pretty ridiculous statement to make as a broad generalization. He spends quite a bit of time talking about this and I don't think it does anyone any good.In the end I think I was most disappointed by the fact that all the elements to create a good book WERE present here, and the failure is due in large part to how he puts it all together and his ability to analyze all the disparate ideas properly (insert irony here). Evolution has built into us shortcuts to react quickly to stimuli in our environment. Our experience, whether broadly cultural or personal, prunes, enhances, changes those built in shortcuts as we go through life. Some develop as unfair biases towards people of different races. Some develop as we become experts in a subject. Thus some can be trusted and some can't. Our brains can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, only between experience and non experience, and so it's important to be aware of what kind of decision making goes on under the surface and what factors are involved in those decisions so we can be more aware of whether to trust them or not. Other factors can affect decision making, such as our emotional state due to the physiological changes that take place during those times, and this too is important to understand because it radically alters our perception during those times. The most important thing to remember is that experience translates into instinct through synaptic change, and through work and training we can increase the effectiveness of our gut reactions and snap decisions, but due to biases and our altered states during emotional situations those instincts should not always be trusted outright.

"Malcolm Gladwell engagingly writes about how decisions made in a blink--snap judgments--can be very good. A series of entertaining anecdotes and psychological studies show that first impressions can be good in some cases, especially in areas where people have experience. He also writes about experts who analyze facial expressions, and how autistic people have trouble making certain types of judgment calls.But then he goes on to show how our unconscious mind can also be very prejudiced. Tall men are more likely to become CEOs than short men. Using Warren Harding as an example, he shows that people may vote for a political candidate because they look presidential. Women are less likely to be offered positions in some orchestras unless the auditions are held with the competitors behind a screen, so they are just evaluated on their playing ability. He also includes stories about police officers making snap judgments, and the judicial system handing out longer sentences to minorities. There were some examples that supported decisions made quickly by the subconscious level, and other examples that showed certain decisions were better when we slowed down and consciously gave things a little more thought. Experience played a big part in having good judgment making quick decisions. Gladwell does not get into how the brain works in making decisions.

"Gladwell continues his exploration of counter-intuitive ideas about decision-making in BLINK! He opens with a 1983 incident at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Museum acquired a rare statue from the Greek archaic period. To this day, the Museum maintains that the authenticity of the statue is uncertain. At the time, however, the Museum was certain enough to acquire the piece for just under $10 million. Documentation, and scientific analysis had been relied on as support. However, numerous experts including Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving pronounced it a fake. It was an intuitive pronouncement which presaged problems later uncovered with both the documentation and scientific analysis. This is the first of many stories Gladwell uses to illustrate how an intuitive reaction can trump logic and analysis.Among the factors that cloud logic is something he calls the adaptive unconscious. It's an unrecognized emotional bias. In the Getty example, the officials wanted the piece to be authentic. It would have been a spectacular acquisition for a newly established museum. This desire diverted critical scrutiny of the supporting evidence. Such an adaptation need not even be emotion based. In an explanation of priming, Gladwell cites psychological studies that illustrate the subconscious effect of pre-conditioning through word lists. Extrapolating from these examples, one might conclude that the casual reader will be highly influenced when reviewing a book by his mood or even surroundings at the time of reading.Gladwell explores other impediments to logical thinking, logic being a type of perceptual filter. Face recognition, he points out, occurs in a completely different part of the brain, and is an integrated reaction as opposed to the kind of multi-step processing that occurs in dealing with language. Athletic and musical achievement rely on these non-verbal neural processes. His own example cites Paul Van Ripper's success against a team backed by the Pentagon's most sophisticated computers in a war games exercise. The Pentagon team was actually hampered in their decision making by information overload. Initial reaction, Gladwell points out is not always accurate. He tries to explore this downside as well by citing studies on bias. Gladwell is an entertaining storyteller as well as an energetic researcher. He draws examples from market research, Chancellorsville in the Civil War, the assessment of heart attacks at Cook County Hospital, speed dating, fire fighting, the auditioning of professional musicians, and the Diallo Incident in the Bronx to illustrate his points. By drawing from such a wide variety of experience, he insures the interest of a broad audience in this book. NOTE: It's always fun to re-encounter characters from other books. I knew of Thomas Hoving from his book, KING OF THE CONFESSORS. The idea of thin-slice thinking was also explored in HOW WE DECIDE, by Jonah Lehrer.

"“We have, as human beings, a storytelling problem. We're a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't really have an explanation for.”

I think this was the first time I experienced a Gladwell book as an audiobook and ever since, it has been my favorite form to consume his books. The quality of production is great and Gladwell narration makes the books even better. I know Gladwell's books are controversial from a scientific point of view as some readers think they're full of contradictions. Personally, I get the feeling that they are well researched, and I never noticed glaring contradictions or mistakes while reading them. Once again, that is only a subjective feeling and they may be not perfect, but I think the way they are written makes them so damn addicting and easy to read.In this book, Gladwell discusses decisions made in the blink of an eye and my favorite kind of non-fiction books are those that affect me somehow and this one did.

"From any psychologist's point of view, this book is full of contradicting psychological facts. Even as a general reader, I find this book says a lot of things but does not actually tell you what it actually wants to address. But I love this book for totally different reasons. Firstly, I love case studies with interesting results written by someone who can write in a way you will find the whole experience exhilarating. Secondly, this guy deserves a five star because he is making less known but thought-provoking scientific studies to a much wider audience. Thirdly, nowhere it is mentioned in the title it is a book which teaches you how to think without thinking so it is completely understandable why it shows us both the advantages and disadvantages of snap decision making and it completely leaves to the reader to decide when to do what. Finally, I love non-fiction which uses a lot of anecdotes to state a fact rather just directly stating the fact it wants to address.

My feelings on this book are quite similar to how I felt about The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (my review) so I'll keep this review short. My first thought after finishing this was: did I really just read 200+ pages on what is essentially the good and bad of gut reactions? There was nothing new for me here and that may not entirely be Gladwell's fault but nevertheless I could not enjoy this book. In addition to my lack of interest in the subject matter, I cannot enjoy the author's writing style. I feel he meanders and that there are so many unfinished thoughts and ideas.

"This is the second part of the collection of articles Malcolm Gladwell has chosen from his writings for The New Yorker. This part is about Personality, Character, And Intelligence. As Gladwell usually does, he tackles quirky subjects and discusses them to come up with conclusions that serves as gateways to larger meanings. In this part he talks about a variety of subject, such as hiring, college graduates, crimes and criminal profiling, and dogs.I LOVE Gladwell's style, and I enjoyed all of his books. But my problem with this one, maybe only this part, is that I didn't enjoy the subjects he tackled.In his previous books, you could see how he takes you bottom up, from small, seemingly random topics, up to the bigger picture. That approach made his other books really interesting, even if you didn't enjoy the small topics he discussed in order to reach his conclusion. In the case of this book, it couldn't be done for the fact that it's merely a collection of his favorite writings.My favorite article in this book was ""Are Smart People Overrated?""Malcom tackles in this article the scandal of Enron. The article is really really interesting. And I enjoyed it the most for the fact that I just joined the corporate world only 6 months ago. Enron went broke for a bad decision its executives have taken. Gladwell takes on this matter from roots to symptoms.","Personality, Character, and Intelligence: Part Three from What the Dog Saw",Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.094,0.781,0.126,0.7614,Positive,,
"What is the difference between choking and panicking? Why are there dozens of varieties of mustard-but only one variety of ketchup? What do football players teach us about how to hire teachers? What does hair dye tell us about the history of the 20th century?In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three books that have radically changed how we understand our world and ourselves: The Tipping Point; Blink; and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from The New Yorker over the same period.Here is the bittersweet tale of the inventor of the birth control pill, and the dazzling inventions of the pasta sauce pioneer Howard Moscowitz. Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the secrets of Cesar Millan, the “dog whisperer” who can calm savage animals with the touch of his hand. He explores intelligence tests and ethnic profiling and “hindsight bias” and why it was that everyone in Silicon Valley once tripped over themselves to hire the same college graduate.“Good writing,” Gladwell says in his preface, “does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else’s head.” What the Dog Saw is yet another example of the buoyant spirit and unflagging curiosity that have made Malcolm Gladwell our most brilliant investigator of the hidden extraordinary.","Personality, Character, and Intelligence: Part Three from What the Dog Saw",Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.053,0.802,0.145,0.9778,Positive,,

"Partial to the “Late Bloomers’ chapter as I have rounded the corners of 50. Tells the story of Ben Fountain, a successful real estate lawyer who decides he want he wants to drop out and write fiction. Eighteen years later, the “young writer” would have success by the age of forty-eight.

This topic tends to dominate any “mom talk” lately with the anxiety just oozing off of all of us as our kids struggle to make what has been ingrained into them and into us “the biggest decision of their lives.” This chapter is well worth the read for anyone going through this patch of life.

"Malcolm Gladwell hand-picked 19 of his own articles from the New Yorker with the running theme of seeing social, political and other issues from outlier, fact-based and/or data-backed perspectives. A highly thought provoking and entertaining read. Areas covered are the likes of:- The Ketchup Conundrum – Mustard Now Comes in Dozens of Varieties. Why Has Ketchup Stayed the Same?- The Art of Failure – Why Some People Choke and Others Panic- Million-Dollar Murray – Why Problems like Homelessness May Be Easier to Solve Than to Manage- The Talent Myth – Are Smart People Overrated?Two of the articles also take deep dives into Enron.As ever Gladwell had been researching like crazy to back up some of these, sometimes incredible takes on business and/or science related issues.

"I’m very fond of Malcolm Gladwell’s writing. It is hard for me to not gush about someone who is living a life I would love to live. I guess I should feel jealous of him, but instead I just feel grateful to know that someone can live that life. And I really love his writing. He is a writer who never leaves his readers behind, who is always beautifully clear and who structures what he has to say in ways that not only compel you to go on reading, but also so he takes you by the hand and makes sure you are always alongside him.It is impossible not to feel perfectly safe with Malcolm Gladwell – and given that some of these articles are about killer dogs and mass murderers, feeling safe with the writer seems almost obligatory.I’m not going to talk about the subject matter of any of these articles – I’m assuming that most of you are going to eventually read them anyway, so it feels a bit pointless spoiling things for you. Instead, I would like to look at how he structures his articles and why I find what he does so utterly compelling.If there is a philosopher that I really admire it is Aristotle. I mean, the guy was a genius and dominated Western thought for two thousands years. It is fair to say that for a very, very long time Western thought, as far as it was ‘thought’, was Aristotelian. But I admire Aristotle because he is so different from me, not in the least because I would like to be like him. If there is one thing I truly know about myself it is that I am nothing like Aristotle. You see, Aristotle was the great categoriser. He had a brain that was like a filing cabinet and he could come to something completely new, something no one had ever thought systematically about before and he the remarkable ability to see how to file things away in this totally new subject. He virtually created many of the disciplines we study now, such as physics, biology, metaphysics, logic, poetics, and the list just goes on and on.I need to make that a bit more clear. It wasn’t just that he could come to a subject like poetics and say (this is not a literal quote, though he does say something similar), ‘the major division is between tragedy and comedy – in tragedy a character gets what he deserves, while in comedy a character gets what he thinks he wants’. It was more that he was able to see that the division between tragedy and comedy was a key division. If you were going to talk about drama, Aristotle just knew that you had to virtually start by talking about that division and how a play that was a comedy was different from a play that was a tragedy. He didn't just invent the filing cabinet, he also put the first labels on the files and then put some gobsmacking content in those files as well.Even while dancing around in my most sunny of dispositions I don't for a moment think that I am anything like Aristotle. I really don’t do categories in the way he does. My mind doesn’t quite work that way – just as I don’t paint like Picasso – but I’ll tell you what, I love it when I see it.And what has this got to do with Gladwell and his latest book? Well, the whole way through this book I kept thinking that Gladwell has learnt so much from Aristotle. He has learnt how to play with categories in ways that are pure delight. What he does looks so simple and so obvious - it is really no wonder that people try (and generally fail) to copy it. It takes lots and lots of hard work to make writing look quite this effortless.I cavalierly started off by saying I wouldn’t tell you anything about the articles in this book and now find I have to – such are the meanderings these reviews take me on. In the last chapter of this book there is a long discussion of what is a Pit Bull Terrier and whether it is the dog or the owner that should be put down after an attack (no prize for guessing the answer to that one). Except, Gladwell’s point is that banning a bred of dog is incredibly difficult, as Pit Bull is a category that is imposed on a wide and various group of individual dogs and as a category it struggles to stretch across all of the dogs it seeks to cover. This is because a category is generally selected to identify a problem – but the dogs themselves aren’t actually the problem – it is the (as they say in France) arseholes that own them. That he then used this distinction to talk about the identification of terrorists and why stopping only people who look like Middle Eastern men is a stupid idea almost had me cheering.In another article he deconstructs the category of FBI Criminal Profiler and confounds it with the category of psychic cold-reader – and not in a complimentary way. In yet another chapter he compares our categories of quarterback (someone who involves himself in a kind of game mostly played, from what I can gather, in the US) and teacher. What Gladwell often does is force us to look again at the categories we use to divide up the world and then to see if they really still make any sense. In a way, he is doing the opposite of what Aristotle did. But either way, I think he does it just as beautifully. As a case in point, it may be that my favourite part of this book is where he says at the end of one of his articles that if we are expected to spend so much time outside of the box perhaps we should be getting a new box. You know, watching someone do that to a cliché (particularly one I hate) is just about the most satisfying thing I can think of.But he doesn’t just tear down old and tired metaphors – he also helps to show interesting distinctions between categories we generally think of as being pretty much about the same things. Like the fascinating distinction he draws between a puzzle and a mystery. Do you see what he does? He uses metaphors in the way that they are meant to be used. A metaphor can be used in two ways: either to stop us thinking or to get us to see something almost as if for the first time. Metaphors that stop us thinking are called clichés – let’s list some: to my way of seeing, thinking outside the box, at the end of the day, let’s unpack that, we should populate this data set … I’d better stop or I’ll be making myself sick. Metaphors can do better than that, though. They can also be used to instruct us in things we don’t know anything about and they do that by comparing the new thing to those things we think we already know very well. In this book when Gladwell discusses how he would like to distinguish between a puzzle and a mystery he uses the example of the sorts of questions that might have been asked during cold war spying on Russia (what is the size of the Soviet economy? how many nuclear weapons does China have?) and then that most amusing of games, where in the world is Osama Bin Laden? to show that these are questions that could be answered if only we had enough new data, if we had enough new information. These are puzzles. They are problems that could be solved if we just had a couple of more pieces.A mystery, though, is something quite different. To solve a mystery you don’t need more information – one of the ‘rules’ of mysteries is that you already have all of the information you need. The problem isn’t that you have too little information, it is that you have far too much and that you have no way of grading the information you’ve got into what is important and what is just trivial noise. And right there you see a new distinction open up between categories that allows you to think anew about a range of issues that might not have made a lot of sense before. Gladwell discusses Watergate as a puzzle and Iraq as a mystery. He then has some very interesting things to say about public accounting of private corporations and whether companies providing us with thousands and thousands of pages of information on how they are going is designed to inform or confuse us. And then asks if maybe we need to not look at company accounts as ways of solving puzzles, but rather if we might not be better off approaching interpreting the health of a company more as a mystery. It is possible that this distinction sounds more profound than it really is – I’m quite prepared to admit that – but all the same, I’m not terribly concerned about that. What it does do is to get me to think about that distinction and to wonder about it. He does this over and over again in all of his books. Needless to say, I really like it.I love Gladwell’s stuff. He brings so much joy and so much interest to his articles that it is always a delight to read him.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.073,0.785,0.141,0.999,Positive,,
"This is an interesting collection of Malcolm Gladwell's writings that were originally published in The New Yorker. In the preface, Gladwell says this collection includes his favorite articles. I've read most of his books, and What the Dog Saw is a similarly fun mix of popular sociology, psychology, economics, social history and marketing. My favorite articles in the bunch were the ones on Ron Popeil, hair color, Cesar Millan, homelessness, plagiarism, criminal profiling and pit bulls. Gladwell is an engaging writer, and I think this collection works so well because the articles are just the right length. Sometimes his books can drag out a subject too long, but like Goldilocks, this book felt ""just right. If you like audiobooks, Gladwell is a good narrator, and these articles are fun to listen to. Highly recommended for Gladwell fans.Opening PassageWhen I was a small child, I used to sneak into my father's study and leaf through the papers on his desk. He is a mathematician. He wrote on graph paper, in pencil — long rows of neatly written numbers and figures. I would sit on the edge of his chair and look at each page with puzzlement and wonder. It seemed miraculous, first of all, that he got paid for what seemed, at the time, like gibberish. But more important, I couldn't get over the fact that someone whom I loved so dearly did something every day, inside his own head, that I could not begin to understand.This was actually a version of what I would later learn psychologists call the other minds problem. One-year-olds think that if they like Goldfish Crackers, then Mommy and Daddy must like Goldfish Crackers, too: they have not grasped the idea that was is inside their head is different from what is inside everyone else's head. Sooner or later, though, children come to understand that Mommy and Daddy don't necessarily like Goldfish, too, and that moment is one of the great cognitive milestones of human development. Why is a two-year-old so terrible? Because she is systematically testing the fascinating, and, to her, utterly novel notion that something that gives her pleasure might not actually give someone else pleasure — and the truth is that as adults we never lose that fascination. Good Biographical Quote""Growing up, I never wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a lawyer, and then in my last year of college, I decided I wanted to be in advertising. I applied to eighteen advertising agencies in the city of Toronto and received eighteen rejection letters, which I taped in a row on my wall. (I still have them somewhere.) I thought about graduate school, but my grades weren't quote good enough. I applied for a fellowship to go somewhere exotic for a year and was rejected. Writing was the thing I ended up doing by default, for the simple reason that it took me forever to realize that writing could be a job. Jobs were things that were serious and daunting.

"In What the Dog Saw, Gladwell offers a treasure chest of gems, each shining brightly on their own. In each essay, Gladwell usually starts with one puzzling situation and then adds information and other narratives to complicate the topic. Then the first situation resurfaces midway and at the conclusion, helping to bring the topic to closure. Most of the time, his underlying thesis runs along the lines of ""Wow, things are a lot more complicated or a lot more simple than they seem."" He's obsessed with patterns -- finding them when they are invisible; complicating them if they are widely accepted.I've been reading all of Gladwell's books, mainly because he comes up in conversation so often. I wanted to weigh in. This book is his fourth published, but it contains essays published before he started doing book-length works. As I said in a review of one of his books, I feel as though his book chapters could be shuffled because he struggles to impose an overarching structure. This collection of essays showcases him in his element; gone is the awkwardness that I find in his book-length works. I read all his works in a large part to answer this question: ""Why is Gladwell so popular?"" Gladwell's writing is tied to a specific moment in time. He's responding to the challenges of the information age--a moment in time where people walk around with hand-held computers and constantly face the task of making judgements about what information is important and what is trivial. He's talking to readers who are drowning in data coming in tidal waves off various screens. Gladwell is throwing them a line. ""Here, hold on to this truism, this observation, this law of human behavior. Stick with me, and you'll keep your head above water."" At first glance Gladwell seems to only offer comfort by pointing out patterns amid seeming chaos. Not so. He most often cautions against imposing patterns where none exist. Gladwell uses examples here and in his book-length works of inaccurate patterns imposed in fields as diverse as these: a) military intelligence b) stock market analysis c) criminal profiling d) cancer detection, e) nuclear power plants, f) animal control, and g) the staffing decisions for filling corporate positions, political seats, orchestra musician positions and football teams. I suspect that he sells a lot of books to people who are hoping to impose order on things, people and ideas. He's very popular with the business set. But if you pay closer attention, Gladwell makes quiet concessions that despite all this will to order, we are defeated by chaos, whimsy, serendipity, folly, and gremlins. (OK, he didn't list gremlins directly.) I don't think he's telling us to abandon the drive to predict and control, but he's certainly pointing out the hubris in believing that we can do so. Consequently, I will now file something with a little fear and trembling. But before I do, here are some specifics, motivated by my will to order the details of his book. ""The Pitchman"" describes the charismatic Ron Popeil, inventor and demonstrator of the Veg-o-Matic. Gladwell describes this amazing pitchman and others of his ilk, contrasting them with actors and ending with the syngergy created when Popeil's methods met live television. ""The Ketchup Coundrum"" describes how various foods are developed, tested and marketed, but the central example explains why ketchup sells for staying focused whereas mustard and spaghetti sauce have diversified. ""Blowing Up"" contrasts two methods of investing on Wall Street--finding patterns and banking on chaos. ""True Colors"" draws the curtain back from the marketing strategies for hair coloring, revealing something about the mind of American women and how the women's movement made ripples through this market. ""John's Rock Error"" explains the rationale of the Pill's inventor as he worked to resolve the science of birth control with his faith as a practicing Catholic. ""What the Dog Saw"" describes how dogs are highly sensitive to the body language of humans, which explains why Ceasar Milan focuses on training owners as a way to better train dogs. ""Open Secrets"" retraces the signs of Enron's risky practices and explains why people didn't see what became so apparent after its fall. ""Million Dollar Murray"" provides shocking data on how the current policies on homelessness actually costs society a great deal of money.""The Picture Problem"" presents the complexities of properly reading mammographies, making screening for this type of cancer particularly challenging. ""Something Borrowed"" discusses the gray areas in intellectual property and Gladwell's own experience of having his words sampled (without credit) into another person's work. ""Connecting the Dots"" bears some similarity to the pattern problems discussed in the Enron article and the mammography article in its discussion of how challenging it is to predict acts of war and terrorism--not because of lack of information but because of an overabundance of it. ""Blowup"" again talks about the issue of information overload, this time in the safety procedures put in place in the space program. Even though the O-rings were viewed as a trouble spot for any space flight, the risk-benefit analysis employed allowed the Challenger to launch, which resulted in tragedy. ""Late Bloomers"" contrasts two forms of genius: the young, experimental types vs. the older, practice-makes-perfect type. The examples of Picasso vs. Cezzanne crystalize his theory, but this essay contains more examples for good measure. ""Most Likely to Succeed"" describes the challenge talent scouts have in predicting an athlete's performance in the NFL based on his performance in college football. It turns out that the two games are vastly different, requiring a different set of skills for success. ""Dangerous Minds"" compares the work of criminal profilers to the work of psychologists, detectives, psychics and other who seek to find a connection between crime and criminal. ""The Talent Myth"" suggests that the value placed on talent has set up some companies and sports teams to overlook other important aspects of their ""players."" Gladwell examines the corporate culture of a handful of companies, such as Enron, Proctor & Gamble, and Southwest--each time looking at how the leaders evaluate performance, personality and group dynamics. ""The New-Boy Network"" hones in on the job interview as an information-gathering task. He surveys psychologists, human resource directors, job applicants and bosses in an effort to describe the dynamics of the interview. ""Troublemakers"" examines the stereotypes about dangerous dog breeds and the statistics for fatal bites. As he did in the title essay about Milan's work with dogs, Gladwell moves his gaze from examining the dog to examining the environment fostered by the dog's owner to ask whether or not banning particular breeds really serves as the best response to the problem of dangerous breeds.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.11,0.795,0.095,-0.9747,Negative,,
"""One day, I'll find a lively, out-of-context anecdote that superficially explains why Malcolm Gladwell bugs me. Until then? I guess he wins."" — Merlin Mann- - -What The Dog Saw is a series of catchy social-science essays by Malcom Gladwell, best known for his long-form books The Tipping Point, Blink, and Outliers. The book's essays are culled from a decade worth of his writing in The New Yorker.I'm on the fence about Malcolm Gladwell. On one hand, his books are thought-provoking and enjoyable. On the other hand, they dabble excessively in storytelling-presented-as-fact. Compared to his books, these 20-30 page essays further soften Gladwell's soft-science approach by simultaneously making his points less pointed and his subject more broad. The essays occasionally felt sprawling and fact-free, bundling casual observations into a scientific-seeming hypothesis. With that said, there were a handful of essays here which were truly outstanding.While interesting, I took these essays with a big grain of salt and just enjoyed them for enjoyment's sake. If you're new to Gladwell, I'd start with one of his books instead.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.0,0.843,0.157,0.9799,Positive,,
"A selection of Gladwell’s writings, most of which appeared originally in the New Yorker magazine. The book has three clusters of essays. The first is about entrepreneurs and “minor geniuses,” such as Ron Popeil of kitchen gadget infomercial fame. Others are Shirley Polykoff, ad writer for Clairol, and Caesar Millan, aka the Dog Whisperer. A lot of this first section is about advertising. We get the now-famous musings about the jam and jelly studies - consumers get overwhelmed by too many choices. Then there are the spaghetti sauce studies: we really can’t conceptualize what we want -- remember the Edsel? But we know it when we taste it and (surprise!) we prefer chunky sauce. The second section is a mixed bag about theorizing and predicting. We read of the Challenger disaster’s O-rings and the judgment calls involved in information sensing in fields as superficially disparate as air photo interpretation and mammography. The last section is about 'personality' and we read essays telling us how little we really learn about people from job interviews and how off-the-mark criminal profiling really is. Great, thought-provoking essays with Gladwell’s easy-to-read but over-confident style of writing.[Revised 6/14/23]",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.023,0.915,0.062,0.6917,Positive,,
"This could be my least favorite book for Gladwell. In my opinion, it is usually hard to construct a book that is likeable enough, out of a collection of articles or blogs. I honestly didn't expect too much out of it.However, being my least favorite doesn't make it bad. It is actually good, real good. For a book that compiles several titles, Galdwell did a good job in explaining each idea and support it with social experiments and Statistics. I can't say that I liked EVERY article, because I didn't. However there were many which piqued my interest. In What The Dog Saw, for example, Malcom categorizes failure into : Panicking and Choking. He states that at time of possible failure, a human could fall into either Thinking too much, or Not Thinking at all. Depending on the situation, panicking or choking could lead to either saving that person, or rushing him to his death. Another example is the effect of plagiarism should pose on someone life. He tells the story of a psychologist invested in studying serial killers who got her book stolen to every last word and turned into a play. Was this thing too bad? Did it have a good impact on the Society?and my most favorite topic is certainly the last one in the book. The fate of all Pitballs were determined because of an accident in which 3 small dogs attacked a child, and the state decided that no one could own a pitball. Poor dogs. Malcom ensures that the cause incident is more complex that one may think. Banning one species will certainly not gonna solve the problem, and in his book, he shall tell you why.What The Dog Saw is a great attempt in a creating a collection of quite interesting stories which tackles a lot of topics at the heart of Sociology, Economy, and Psychology.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.158,0.706,0.136,-0.8414,Negative,,
"Not my typical reading fare - you can tell by the dearth of nonfiction on my Goodreads shelf and the time it took me to read this. What the Dog Saw is divided into three sections: Part 1 - Obsessives, Pioneers, and Other Varieties of Minor Genius, Part 2 - Theories, Predictions, and Diagnoses, and Part 3 - Personality, Character, and Intelligence.I didn't enjoy Part 1 as much as 2 or 3 because I could not connect with the anecdotes or the characters within each short story. They weren't actual fiction stories but little narratives of real events that happened - I suppose the fact that I read this portion of the book in a similar way to fiction showcases Malcolm Gladwell's storytelling talent.Part 2 was where I started to get hooked. My two favorite stories were Something Borrowed and The Art of Failure. Something Borrowed questioned plagiarism and how society perceives it today as opposed to in the past. The Art of Failure began with describing a tennis match and transitioned into the difference between choking and panicking.I loved every story of Part 3 - I read the entire section in a day. Gladwell writes about aspects of contemporary society with a fine felicity. This part of the book made buying it worth the money.What the Dog Saw is an extraordinary collection of essays that are written with intelligence and precision. The research Malcolm Gladwell must have put into each of these stories amazes me - now I want to reread some of his previously published works.Want to read more of my writing?

"Good writing “succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else’s head.”Malcolm Gladwell expressed this idea (and his hopes for a reader’s takeaway) in his forward to WHAT THE DOG SAW, a collection of his favourite essays, “even if in the end you conclude that someone else’s head is not a place you’d really like to be.”Well, this reader was absolutely thrilled to his toes by this brief trip into Malcolm Gladwell’s mind and his evocative, thought-provoking, and eyebrow-raising collection of ideas on a very eclectic range of topics – flavours of mustard and ketchup; the inevitability of disaster in investment strategy; hiring practices and policies, and the efficacy of job interviews; crime, pit bulls, and dog whispering; criminal profiling; the subtle differences between choking and panicking; the history of birth control pills; and much, much more.The essays are a little bit too long to be considered as toilet reading but if you’d like to add a non-fiction book to your reading that can be taken in wonderfully enjoyable one or two hour long bite-sized chunks and read side-by-side with your favourite suspense thriller without being the least bit disruptive, then WHAT THE DOG SAW will do the trick in spades! (LOL, trick in spades? See what I did there?)Given the left/right head-butting that is currently taking place in the USA over issues of a female’s rights to autonomy over their own bodies, the article on reproductive health and mammography is particularly timely and poignant.As Gladwell said, you might not agree with his opinions, but it would be impossible to read WHAT THE DOG SAW without being moved to deeper thought on your own opinions and gaining a serious helping of reading pleasure in the process. Definitely recommended.Paul Weiss",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.068,0.802,0.131,0.9751,Positive,,
"What the Dog saw….What the Dog Saw … is sort of a bunch of essays that Gladwell has published in The New Yorker. What I like about his work is that it is packed with common sense and good judgment, but always from his point of view… and then the dog’s. What always draws me in is his ability to ferret out the hidden facts that are quite visible, once he points them out.He finds the most interesting points in things like selling kitchen appliances, or the Ketchup wars, and contraceptive pills… did you know that had they been marketed differently, the Catholic Church would have probably given them a blessing and a pass? My favorite was Cesar– the celebrity dog-whisperer and how he works. The book continues with a Gladwell review of the Enron investigation… and homeless people. He always has his eye on moral dilemmas… If you like straightforward writing … you can’t avoid reading this.4 starsHappy Reading!",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.044,0.811,0.146,0.9519,Positive,,
"Malcolm Gladwell is a Canadian journalist, author and speaker who has written 6 books. What the Dog Saw is a compilation of 19 articles by Malcolm Gladwell that were originally published in The New Yorker and are categorized into three parts. The first part, Obsessives, Pioneers, and other varieties of Minor Genius, describes people who are very good at what they do, but are not necessarily well-known. Part two, Theories, Predictions, and Diagnoses, describes the problems associated with prediction. This section covers problems such as intelligence failure, and the fall of Enron. The third section, Personality, Character, and Intelligence, discusses a wide variety of psychological and sociological topics ranging from the difference between early and late bloomers to criminal profiling.I listened to the author read his book. I liked all of the 19 stories; learned something new from each one. My favorites?1) John Rock's Error What the co-inventor of the Pilldidn't know about menstruationcan endanger women's health.2) The Picture ProblemMammography, Air Power, The Limits of LookingThese two dealt with women's health issues and really spoke to me.The links for all 19 articles can be found on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_th...4 stars",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.101,0.831,0.068,-0.7878,Negative,,
"This is a series of essays, non-fiction. They were very smart and interesting. 1.) The Pitchman is a about a salesman. 2.) The Ketchup Conundrum is about how tastes are developed and how people deal with challenges to that developed taste. 3.) Blowing Up is about investment strategy, it's kind of boring. 4.) True Colors. This is about hair dye and advertising. I liked it. 5.) John Rock's Error. This was about birth control. He raises some interesting points, but I don't know if I agree with all of them. 6.) What the Dog Saw. An article about Cesar Millan, the dog trainer. I really liked this article, even though it was less about training dogs and more about whether Millan knows some secret body-language. 7.) Open Secrets. An article about Entron. 8.) Million-Dollar Murray. An article about homelessness. 9.) The Picture Problem. About the limits of pictures, as tied to mammograms and satellite. Very interesting, and he brings up some good points about pictures. 10.) Something Borrowed. An article about plagiarism. He makes some very good and interesting points. 11.) Connecting the Dots. An article about national intelligence. He makes very good points. 12.) The Art of Failure. An article about the differences between choking and panicking. Very interesting. 13.) Blowup. An article about the Challenger, and NASA, and space missions failing. 14.) Late Bloomers. An interesting article on people who come into their talent later in life, and about sponsorship. 15.) Most Likely to Succeed. An interesting article about talent. 16.) Dangerous Minds. An interesting article about profiling. 17.) The Talent Myth. Are smart people overrated? How should companies be structured and operate? 18.) The New-Boy Network. An article about job interviews, judgment and first impressions. 19.) Troublemakers. An article about pit bulls. Are they dangerous, or is it their owners? Making assumptions about NYC being violent. Racial profiling.

"I finally-finally finished it! But not because it is boring - it is collection of articles by Gladwell, so it does not go down like one single book. All articles clearly demonstrate inquisitive mind and quick wit of Gladwell, but not all of them are of equal interest and thrill. Some articles feel like they are concocted out of thin air, some are too plain and unexcited. But I was fascinated by the stories of colorant revolution in the US, value of talent and specifics of human perceptions at job interviews.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.075,0.707,0.218,0.9502,Positive,,
"A little background: I really love Malcolm Gladwell. I was first introduced to him through my Persuasion class I took while studying abroad last summer. We had to read Blink, his first published book; it was one of the most interesting books I have ever read for a class. He is no stranger to writing, though. His full-time occupation is as a journalist for the New Yorker.Why is he so amazing, might you ask? I'll tell you. Malcolm Gladwell has this amazing ability in his writing to find things that are seemingly unrelated ideas and anecdotes, and relate them to each other in radical ways. What the Dog Saw is different than his previous books, in that it is a compilation of articles he has written for the New Yorker, organized around a cohesive idea: people who try to understand other people. Here's a short summary of each chapter/article:1) The Pitchmen. This article talks about the original family of pitchmen (like Billy Mays). Basically the Popeil family is reallyl inventive and can sell people boxes of crap because they're so good at their job (... not that they would ever sell you a crappy product). Not only are they excellent pitchmen, but they would spend countless hours in the workshop. One of their inventions, the kitchen rotisserie, had over 200 patents on it alone.2) The Ketchup Conundrum. Why is it that there are dozens of kinds of mustard but only one kind of ketchup? Well it turns out there are a lot of reasons. For example, did you know that there are five kinds of taste? Sweet, Salty, Sour, Bitter, and Umami. Umami is a more recent discovery, as it's much harder to place than the first four kinds of taste. It comes from protein and amino acids (so it's prevelant in foods like chicken noodle soup and seaweed). Ketchup is a rare food that has all five tastes in one and is all perfectly blended so you're not left with the aftertaste of one over another. A lot of other reasons, too. Who knew ketchup was so fascinating!3) Blowing Up. I'm a little fuzzy on the details of this chapter because it talked about investments and other stuff that my knowledge is sketchy on. It was still really interesting, though. Basically it talks about this guy, Nassim Taleb, takes a completely different approach to investments than anybody else. His way is harder for people to accept, because it can lead to losing small amounts of money over a long period of time with no risk of losing big time, rather than the current way which is to take a huge risk that can either pay off big or leave you completely destitute.4) True Colors. The history of hair dye. The story of a beauty product that ended up being deeply connected to women and their changing identities through the fifties and sixties. The way in which they were advertised by two women prominent in the advertising industry mirrored the way women felt about themselves and what dying their hair meant to them and the role they played in society.5) John Rock's Error. One of my favorite pieces, this article talks about the history of birth control. So much info here, about the relevance of Catholicism to the method of the pill, how women's menstraul cycles have changed with modern times and technology, and the medical benefits of birth control (being on the pill lowers your risk of ovarian cancer -- crazy!)6) What the Dog Saw. This article is about Millan the Dog Whisperer, how he came to his job, how he works with dogs, and with people, and the body gestures and signals that we process subconsciously that leads to his success.7) Open Secrets. Enron, the huge scandal of the 90's, was actually not as secretive as firsts accused. Rather, it shows the problem of too much information, rather than not enough. Enron did not hide anything so much as they did not explain how their business worked in a way that was understood by the majority of people (including most of the people on their executive board).8) Million-Dollar Murray. Homelessness is actually cheaper to solve by giving them paid-for apartments and individual service than things like homeless shelters and soup kitchens. In general, the majority of homeless people are not homeless for long; it is only a few people that are costing the big bucks, the chronically homeless. Fix them, and you fix the bulk of the problem.9) The Picture Problem. Another fascinating article for women. In overview, reading and interpreting mammograms correctly is a much sketchier process than we might realize. He relates it, quite well, to the problem the military has with correclty interpreting infrared pictures of possible terrorist targets.10) Something Borrowed. Should plagiarism in writing be that big of a deal? He has a personal anecdote here of a woman who wrote a play that became very famous, but was quickly pulled after she was accused by a woman of having her life story blatantly used as the plot of the main character, based off an article that Malcolm Gladwell had written about her. While the woman had a legitimate complaint, Gladwell muses about the morality of plagiarism, and the idea that all art and creativity is based off something else, which makes a very fine line.11) Connecting the Dots. Was the terrorist of 9/11 really preventable? The previous chapter on Enron touches on the fact of too much information can be worse than too little, and that same argument is made here. American intelligence agencies had so much information, so many ""tips"", that it became very difficult to separate the fact from the fiction. It's not about having the information, but being able to connect the dots between what is already there.12) The Art of Failure. What is the difference between ""choking"" and ""panicking""? Turns out, quite a lot. Both create separate physical reactions and come from different places. Here Gladwell goes into the plane crash of the Kennedy son, what he was experiencing at the time, and why it happened.13) Blowup. Who is to blame for the explosion of NASA's Challenger? Human nature wants to say that something can definitely be fixed, or somebody was definitely to blame, for an accident of that magnitude. But in reality, it wasn't one big blunder as much as a lot of little calculations, that individually are not considered critical, but all culminated at once to produce a disaster; and really, there's no way to prevent against that.14) Late Bloomers. Why is it that we only call people ""geniuses"" if they come to fruition when they're young? Aren't old geniuses possible? Turns out, we have another term for them, ""masters"", and the approach of the two are completely different, but equally interesting.15) Most Likely to Succeed. How do you hire someone if you don't know who qualifies for the job? Gladwell uses two examples here, quarterbacks who transition from college to pro, and financial advisors, to culminate into the idea that the system for hiring public school teachers is in need of a drastic reformation. All three of these areas are jobs where it is impossible to tell who is good at it until they are actually immersed in the program.16) Dangerous Minds. Criminal profiling, at it's surface, seems an amazing ability of psychologists to get at the heart of a person based of superficial facts of a crime scene. However, it may be more of a hoax than originally thought, and not really that helpful in catching the bad guy.17) The Talent Myth. Are smart people overrated? Enron comes into play again, as they had a different outlook on how people were promoted and rewarded in their company. If you were smart, if you had ""talent"", you got what you wanted and were given enormous responsibility, whether or not you were really qualified for the task. And... it may have blown up in their face.18) The New-Boy Network. If you think about it, hiring somebody based off a piece of paper and spending at most an hour with them in an interview seems extremely superficial and basic. So why is it that we make such a big decision based off that? Again, more subconscious work at play here.19) Troublemakers. One of the saddest articles, I think. Pit bulls are unfairly stereotyped in several countries, and in many states in the U.S. Banned as viscious and human aggressive dogs, the truth points more toward the owners of the dogs and the lifestyle the dog is brought up in.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.098,0.8,0.103,0.6106,Positive,,
"I know, I know. Malcolm Gladwell brings out extremes in readers. In one camp, you have rabid fans who think he is a transcendent genius, who will change previously held beliefs on the strength of one carefully crafted and engaging TED talk. On the other, you have cynics who sneer at the lemmings who behave as I previously described and dismiss him as a pop psychologist. Ok, perhaps that was even more extreme in my description, but the point is I'm in the middle. If one thinks of him as a philosopher type writer, who surveys the cultural landscape and synthesizes media into strangely compelling and interesting books and articles, I think it's far easier to just enjoy him, without having to laugh in one's sleeve at an over simplification, or get all starry eyed at an idea he is presenting. ""What the Dog Saw"" is a great compilation of a series of articles, broken down into three main sections based around certain themes. I really enjoyed this book, even though at times it seems he goes out of his way to pick the most disparate topics, compare them, and then make some far fetched and often counter intuitive conclusion- my partner and I joked that he is so contrary, one often just has to think of the commonly held idea around a subject, think of the total opposite, and one can safely bet Gladwell will set up camp around the latter. But again, if one takes him as a pondering philosopher, instead of a last word, infallible source, he is a great resource for sparking new thoughts on old ideas, and for re-examining long held beliefs. My favorite chapters were on homelessness in Denver, and plagiarism. I like that Gladwell seems to be a big, curious kid, willing to do research on random topics and hang out with weird (a compliment) people and write from a different point of view.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.04,0.799,0.162,0.9922,Positive,,

"There seems to have been a bit of a backlash against Malcolm Gladwell during the last year, but this book, a collection of his New Yorker pieces, reminds us why he achieved such prominence to begin with. Gladwell's particular talent is to take a subject which might seem initially to be irredeemably dull and to poke at it from all sides until he locates the particular angle which will allow him to tell a story, simultaneously entertaining and edifying his readers. There's a little more to it than that, of course: in particular, a seemingly unbounded curiosity about why the world is the way it is, and the skill to craft narratives that engage the general reader without being either boring or condescending. One of the factors which contributes greatly to his success is an almost uncanny ability to explain technically complicated material in an accessible manner - he makes this seem so effortless that I think people have begun to take this aspect of his work for granted. I think it's anything but effortless, that it takes hard work every time and he is one of only a handful of writers to pull it off regularly. You may find yourself disagreeing with something that Gladwell is telling you, but you generally won't have too much difficulty figuring it out. Gladwell groups the essays in this book into three broad categories:Part 1: Obsessives, pioneers, and other varieties of minor geniusPart 2: Theories, predictions, and diagnosesPart 3: Personality, character, and intelligenceIn the first part, which includes profiles of Ron Popeil (the infomercial king), Cesar Millan (the dog whisperer), Nassim Taleb (contrarian investor and author of ""Fooled by Randomness""), as well as chapters on ketchup, hair coloring, and the history of the contraceptive pill, Gladwell sticks closest to his source material, avoiding the kind of premature generalization that is his Achilles heel. He isn't always successful in doing so in the remaining parts so that, while his lucid common sense on the topics of mammography, plagiarism, homelessness, and criminal profiling is a breath of fresh air, his arguments about organizational culture (the Enron debacle, the Challenger explosion) and predictors of individual performance (why some people choke and others panic, are smart people overrated?) are not entirely persuasive.Nonetheless, this is a fine collection.

"I hadn't realized this was a collection of Gladwell's essays, many (most? all?) have seen publication in the New Yorker.

His evaluation of What the Dog Saw is mostly laudatory pretty hostile*, although and he takes the opportunity to get a dig in at Outliers:The reasoning in “Outliers,” which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle.

This book was just a mish-mash of stories, some good, some so so, but mostly unrelated or at least I was too dumb to get the central theme. Gladwell's story telling capabilities were intact so it was still somewhat entertaining but the lack of a central theme made me feel it it was running all over the place with it's head cut off.

"After being rejected by more than a dozen advertising agencies, Malcolm Gladwell went from obscurity to literary reverence. I mean the guy can write. Not just write but write about stuff we take so for granted and wish we had asked the same questions he asks.One of the most imaginative non-fiction writers of our times, a man who not has had 3 best sellers and a title to die for (being judged as the Time magazine’s 100 most influential people) – his strength is his innate ability to make his readers think and think really deep.Gladwell’s latest concoction of articles that he mixed into this recipe titled ‘What the dog saw’ is not just another master-piece in itself, it boarder lines between absolute genius to total unwanted and unnecessary banal details of generalized points of view, leaving you with many more questions than you would hope for. I mean the guy is great in his observations but then again you would ask yourself, do you really want to know all what he has spend time researching on or is it better to just know a few bits and forget the rest? I think that is a question you would have to ask yourself.So what do we have in this brilliant bible of articles? Here are a few thoughts..Have you ever wondered why there is only one kind of ketchup but so many kinds of mustards?What made the Veg-O-Matic so successful and why?Cesar Millan, the American ""Dog Whisperer"" – How did he manage to tame any ferocious wild dog by just ‘whispering’ to the dog…Or rather…what did the dog see that the dog choose to listen to an unknown human being?All this and much more with the shards of Nassim Taleb (author of the best seller ‘Black Swan’ and ‘Fooled by Randomness’) to where Led Zeppelin got his magic note in ‘Whole Lotta Love’, to the toxic historical disasters of Enron, the envious success of George Soros and Warren Buffet and finally to why it is a venial sin to prognosticate either breeds of dogs, serial killers or for that matter successful corporate honchos.The book is filled with all these brilliant findings that make you think and at times give you an awful headache as to how much there is to know. But you have to admit – the indefatigably curious journalist and writer whose brand today is defined in terms of ‘counter intuitive findings from little known experts’, I have to admit, I love reading his work.The only criticism Malcolm Gladwell can face is being categorized as an eccentric essayist and a dilettante who postulates inconspicuous statistical data spiced up with misleading definitions and magnifies it to sound very credible and convincing yet banal, boring and bluntly ineffective.I would only tell those critics – Shut up dude. I honestly didn’t understand what you said. But I did understand what Malcolm is trying to say (though deep down I still wonder if I did…)All in all, brilliant read and a worth while addition to your collection of books though many a times, it can be boring having stacked up with excessive information which you may not want to know about.Overall rating – 6 out of 10.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,3.0,0.098,0.746,0.156,0.9916,Positive,,
"Non-Fiction. A collection of essays previously published in The New Yorker, with publication dates ranging from 1997 to 2008.Gladwell is at his pop science best here, taking on Enron, corporate hiring practices, pitbulls, homelessness, Cesar Millan, plagiarism, and the hair color industry. He even manages to make stock options transparent for a while. As always, his writing is deft, easy, and accessible.I particularly enjoyed the piece on the Morris-Popeil (of the Ron Popeil Popeils) Dynasty, the essay on ketchup and why it's no mustard (this made me crave French fries so desperately I nearly threw the book down and took off for McDonald's mid-essay), and the articles on military intelligence and mammograms.The essay on birth control was one of the first things I'd ever read by Gladwell and it impressed me a lot at the time. Today it raised more questions than praise. The essay, written in 2000, says the Pill was wrongly accused of causing blood clots in the late 1960s. Oral contraceptives cause blood clots now, but they also have a vastly different hormonal profile than the original Pill. A brief Google of the internet has nothing to say on the subject, so I can't back myself up here, but something's off. Gladwell adds footnotes to update several articles, but the blood clot issue -- as well as new findings connecting artificial hormones and cancer in female bodies -- goes unaddressed.Several of these pieces felt too short; I'd turn the page and be surprised it was over, and if you've read Blink you're already familiar with the concept, and much of the research, behind ""The New-Boy Network,"" but if you like Gladwell, you'll like this book.Four stars. Gladwell has a real gift for setting a scene and getting across a lot of information in a way that doesn't make it feel like someone dumped an encyclopedia on your head. eBook related content: This epub has a footnote to nowhere! Actually, it links to a different, unrelated footnote, but that was weird. A bigger problem is that almost every acronym in this book is rendered in italics for no good reason. And it's not consistent; if the acronym is near certain punctuation marks, it's not in italics. Obviously the formatting got borked somewhere.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.058,0.838,0.104,0.9459,Positive,,
"I didn't buy this book because it is a collection of already published articles, nearly all of which I have read already. But I saw it at the library and decided to read it anyway. What a wonderfully fun experience. There are quite a few criticism I could make of these articles. Gladwell is a storyteller and sometimes lets telling a good story take precedence over reality. In his case, this usually means making all of the pieces fit together just so, instead of revealing the messy way that the world doesn't always fit together right. I could go on, but the fact is: I really like reading these articles. Some of them are as fun and as fine as great short stories. And sometimes those pieces really do fit together exactly the way he implies.I loved the opening piece on Ron Popeil, of Ronco informercial fame. An inventor and a pitchman; I enjoyed seeing his familiar patter through Gladwell's eyes. I liked reading about Nathan Taleb; I've read The Black Swan and, again, it was neat to see him through Gladwell's eyes. Likewise Cesar Milan and his dogs. His essay on culture and hair coloring products puts together a story that puts to shame all of those people trying to view the culture through one lens or another...I could go on about plagiarism, homelessness (and pollution), cancer detection (and terrorism) and so on.... But that's enough for me to remember why I liked this book so much.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.06,0.721,0.219,0.9938,Positive,,
"I've got to hand it to Malcolm Gladwell; the man knows how to engage his reader. What the Dog Saw is a collection of articles Gladwell has written over the last ten years or so, each about 20-30 pages. Frankly, I think this is the perfect length for his writings, long enough to delve into the topic, but not so long that it feels he's making the same point over and over. The Time review called Gladwell ""an omniscient, many-armed Hindu god of anecdotes,"" and that's actually what it feels like to read this book. A single article will connect two seemingly unrelated things in a way that makes you wonder why you never put them together before: NFL quarterbacks and kindergarten teachers; mammograms and military bombing missions; homelessness in Denver, aggressive cops in LA, and super-polluting cars. It's amazing.As always, I don't think Gladwell's point is to force you to agree with him, it's to make you challenge your conventional view of the world. In one article, he argues that it might be easier to solve the homeless problem than to manage it, but that doing so goes against our moral sense of fairness. In another, he explains that traditional employment interviews don't work, and the ones that do work are highly unpopular because they don't follow our intuition about evaluating people. In yet another, he describes how the Challenger explosion or the meltdown at Three Mile Island might really be nobody's fault. Just thinking about these issues is enough to make you start second-guessing all sorts of conventional wisdom, and I think that's what makes Gladwell's writing so valuable. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what he comes out with next.",What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,Malcolm Gladwell,4.0,0.041,0.835,0.123,0.974,Positive,,
"I think I have a like/indifferent thing going with Malcolm Gladwell. I find so many of his insights truly fascinating, while others float by me with a big whiff of ""annnnddddd sooooooo?????"" Sometimes I just wish he'd hit me over the head a little harder with a summary of his point and maybe every so often a call-to-action with a suggestion of what to do with the knowledge he's just imparted.

"En aquest assaig, Malcolm Gladwell t'explica, amb exemples, les dos formes de fallar: o t'ofegues o entres en pànic. Explica que la sensació d'ofegar-se, és quan percibeixes un ambient molt abrumador i baix l'estrés, el teu subconscient torna al principi de quan estaves aprenent qualsevol disciplina; ja no actues de forma automàtica sino que sobrepenses els teus moviments i perds l'experiència que tens. Mentre que quan entres en pànic és al contrari, tal vegada per falta d'experiència t'agarres a lo primer que veus i actues de forma automàtica. Explica també un concepte super interessant que es denomina la ""amenaça estereotípica"", que és bàsicament que persones subjectes a certs estereotips de raça, gènere o etc, quan els poses a ""competir"" amb el grup estereotípicament dominant, per voler demostrar que l'estereotip es fals, faran la tasca de pitjor manera, ja que començaran a fer les coses de manera cuidadosa i a qüestionar el que saben (en lloc de deixar que actue la part de la ment que és més intuitiva). Com a una xica xulíssima que tot el que fa en la vida es fallar, fallar i fallar m'ha paregut súper interessant. Entendre el que ens passa, identificar conductes i ser conscients dels nostres actes, de les nostres emocions, ajuda a que estem preparats per a qualsevol situació del futur.",The Art of Failure,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.011,0.97,0.019,0.4019,Positive,,
"Read at: http://www.infosurvey.com.my/The%20Ar...I forget which book Gladwell talks about choking vs panicking, so most of this was familiar. But Gladwell is such an excellent writer I don’t mind rereading.“Human beings sometimes falter under pressure. Pilots crash and divers drown. Under the glare of competition, basketball players cannot find the basket and golfers cannot find the pin. When that happens, we say variously that people have “panicked” or, to use the sports colloquialism, “choked.” But what do those words mean? Both are pejoratives. To choke or panic is considered to be as bad as to quit. But are all forms of failure equal? And what do the forms in which we fail say about who we are and how we think? We live in an age obsessed with success, with documenting the myriad ways by which talented people overcome challenges and obstacles. There is as much to be learned, though, from documenting the myriad ways in which talented people sometimes fail.“Choking” sounds like a vague and all-encompassing term, yet it describes a very specific kind of failure.”Love that he then talks about implicit and explicit learning; “These two learning systems are quite separate, based in different parts of the brain.”“Panic also causes what psychologists call perceptual narrowing.” It why we remind people on planes that exits may be behind them.“Panic, in this sense, is the opposite of choking. Choking is about thinking too much. Panic is about thinking too little. Choking is about loss of instinct. Panic is reversion to instinct. They may look the same, but they are worlds apart.”Yes! Stereotype threat is a type of ‘choking’.“sometimes a poor performance reflects not the innate ability of the performer but the complexion of the audience; and that sometimes a poor test score is the sign not of a poor student but of a good one.”",The Art of Failure,Malcolm Gladwell,5.0,0.245,0.684,0.072,-0.9967,Negative,,
"Gladwell has an amazing talent for telling stories so well. I can never get the same kind of flow with any other author. A master of his craft can always make any little thing interesting.
